## Setting up an FNet Node

To participate in FNet, a special non-production network run by the Algorand Foundation for testing and development purposes, follow these steps:

<Steps>
1. **Install the Node**

    Install a node via the normal instructions for your platform at https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/setup/install/. When the node begins to sync with Mainnet, stop the node. We will restart it after making two changes so that the node will connect to and sync with FNet.

2. **Get the FNet Genesis File**

   A special `genesis.json` file has been prepared to initialize FNet. The file can be downloaded from http://relay-us-no-2.algorand.green:8184/genesis. An easy way to retrieve and install the file is to use `curl` and output directly to a file:

   ```bash showLineNumbers=false
   curl http://relay-us-no-2.algorand.green:8184/genesis --output $ALGORAND_DATA/genesis.json
   ```

3. **Configure the DNS Bootstrapping**

   In the node's data directory, copy `config.json.example` to `config.json` to create a fresh configuration file. Edit the `config.json` file, change the setting for DNS Bootstrap ID to be `"DNSBootstrapID": "<network>.algorand.green"` and save the file.

4. **Restart the Node**

   With the FNet `genesis.json` file in place and the modified `config.json` file, start the node. The node will now connect to FNet and begin syncing with the network. If the node has started successfully, use `goal node status` to confirm that the node is running and and connected to FNet by checking the Genesis ID and Genesis hash in the response:

   ```bash showLineNumbers=false
   $ goal node status
   Last committed block: 11433
   Time since last block: 0.3s
   Sync Time: 0.0s
   Last consensus protocol: future
   Next consensus protocol: future
   Round for next consensus protocol: 11434
   Next consensus protocol supported: true
   Last Catchpoint:
   Genesis ID: fnet-v1                                        # <-- FNet ID
   Genesis hash: u4Z+obkOEPog2v7a85CGchwkZnw3h7ZcYnDp0e3/jnY= # <-- FNet hash
   ```

</Steps>

You are now running an Algorand node on FNet. Remember that FNet will be reset periodically, so you may need to repeat Step 2 and restart your node when the network is restarted from a new genesis file.

## Participating in Consensus Incentives

In order to participate in consensus and be eligible for incentives, you have have at least 30,000 ALGO in your account and register the participation keys for that account as online with a transaction fee of at least 2 ALGO (2,000,000uA).

```bash
curl $(cat $ALGORAND_DATA/algod.net)/v2/accounts/ZH5RDHCR6FQ46DZXCTMDZZBWPQ4JVFMCZCRLV6QK4EMC5LEJ6NKLU6XR24 -H "X-Algo-API-Token: $ALGOD_TOKEN" | jq
```

From within the fnet-v1 directory (you may need to `sudo su` to cd into this directory) you can query the SQLite database to get more clientInformation.

```bash
sqlite3 -noheader ledger.block.sqlite "SELECT hex(hdrdata) FROM blocks;" | tr -d '\n' | xxd -p -r | msgpacktool -d -strict | jq -r '."prp:b64" // empty' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | while read num addr; do printf "%5d %s\n" "$num" "$(echo $addr | base64 -d | base32)"; done
```

## New fields on the block header related to incentives

From go-algorand/data/bookkeeping/block.go:

    	// Proposer is the proposer of this block. Like the Seed, agreement adds
    	// this after the block is assembled by the transaction pool, so that the same block can be prepared
    	// for multiple participating accounts in the same node. Therefore, it can not be used
    	// to influence block evaluation. Populated if proto.Payouts.Enabled
    	Proposer basics.Address `codec:"prp"`

    	// FeesCollected is the sum of all fees paid by transactions in this
    	// block. Populated if proto.Payouts.Enabled
    	FeesCollected basics.MicroAlgos `codec:"fc"`

    	// Bonus is the bonus incentive to be paid for proposing this block.  It
    	// begins as a consensus parameter value, and decays periodically.
    	Bonus basics.MicroAlgos `codec:"bi"`

    	// ProposerPayout is the amount that should be moved from the FeeSink to
    	// the Proposer at the start of the next block.  It is basically the
    	// bonus + the payouts percent of FeesCollected, but may be zero'd by
    	// proposer ineligibility.
    	ProposerPayout basics.MicroAlgos `codec:"pp"`
