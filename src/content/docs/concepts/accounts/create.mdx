Algorand offers multiple approaches to account creation, in this guide we'll explore the various methods available for creating accounts on the Algorand blockchain. Depending on your needs, consider [standalone accounts](#standalone), [wallet-derived accounts](#wallet-derived) using [kmd](/nodes/reference/artifacts#kmd) (Key Management Daemon), or [multi-signature accounts](/concepts/accounts/multisig) (which entails one of the prior methods). This section will explore standalone accounts and wallet-derived accounts in-depth, guiding how to utilize them in `algokit-utils` , `goal`, `algokey`, `SDKs`, and `Pera Wallet`, the reasons you might want to choose one method over another for your application.

:::caution
Remember that accounts participating in transactions are required to maintain a minimum balance of 100,000 micro Algos. Before using a newly created account in transactions, make sure that it has a sufficient balance by transferring at least 100,000 micro Algos to it. An initial transfer of under that amount will fail due to the minimum balance constraint. Refer [funding an account](/concepts/accounts/funding) for more details.

## Standalone

A standalone account is an Algorand address and private key pair that is not stored on disk. The private key is most often in the [25-word mnemonic form](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/accounts/#transformation-private-key-to-25-word-mnemonic).

### Reasons to use standalone accounts

- Low setup cost: No need to connect to a separate client or hardware; all you need is the 25-word human-readable mnemonic of the relevant account.
- Supports offline signing: Since private keys are not stored on disk, standalone accounts can be used in [secure offline-signing procedures](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/transactions/offline_transactions) where hardware constraints may make using kmd more difficult.
- Widely supported: Standalone account mnemonics are commonly used across various Algorand developer tools and services.

:::note
Algorand's mobile wallet (Android, iOS) uses standalone accounts. Use the 25-word mnemonic to import accounts into the mobile wallet.
:::

### Reasons not to use standalone accounts

- Lack of encrypted storage: If you prefer storing keys securely on disk rather than as a 25-word mnemonic, kmd may be a better choice.
- Limited direct import/export options: Developers relying on import and export functions may find kmd more suitable, as [Algokit Utils](#algokit-utils) provides import and export capabilities.

### How to generate a standalone account

There are different ways to create a standalone account:

#### Algokey

Algokey is a command-line utility for managing Algorand keys and it is used for generating, exporting, and importing keys.

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
$ algokey generate
Private key mnemonic: [PASSPHRASE]
Public key: [ADDRESS]
```

#### Algokit Utils

AlgoKit Utils simplifies the creation and management of standalone Algorand accounts in both Python and TypeScript by abstracting the complexities of Algorand SDKs, allowing developers to generate new accounts, retrieve existing ones, and manage private keys securely.

By leveraging AlgoKit Utils, developers can programmatically create accounts without depending on external key management systems, making it ideal for lightweight applications, offline signing, and minimal setup scenarios. AlgoKit Utils offers multiple ways to create and manage standalone accounts.

##### Random Account Generation

Developers can generate random accounts dynamically, each with a unique public/private key pair.

:::note
You can also create an account from environment variables as a standalone account. If it's not LocalNet, the account will be treated as standalone and loaded using mnemonic secret. Ensure the mnemonic is handled securely and not committed to source control.

#### Pera Wallet

Pera Wallet is a popular non-custodial wallet for the Algorand blockchain. For more details, refer to the guided tutorial on [How to create a new account on Pera Wallet](https://support.perawallet.app/en/article/create-a-new-algorand-account-on-pera-wallet-1ehbj11/).

:::note
The Algorand community provides many wallets that can be used to create an Algorand account as well. See [Wallets](https://developer.algorand.org/ecosystem-projects/?tags=wallets) for more details.
:::

#### Vault Wallet

HashiCorp Vault implementation can also be used for managing Algorand standalone accounts securely. By leveraging Vault, you can store private keys and 25-word mnemonics securely, ensuring sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access. This implementation provides a streamlined way to create and manage standalone accounts while maintaining best practices for key management.

The integration is particularly useful for developers and enterprises seeking a secure, API-driven approach to manage Algorand accounts at scale, without relying on local storage or manual handling of sensitive credentials.

## Wallet-derived

The Key Management Daemon is a process that runs on Algorand nodes, so if you are using a third-party API service this process likely will not be available to you. kmd is the underlying key storage mechanism used with `goal`.

### Reasons to use kmd

- Single Master Derivation Key: Public/private key pairs are generated from a single master derivation key. You only need to remember the single mnemonic that represents this master derivation key (i.e. the wallet passphrase/mnemonic) to regenerate all of the accounts in that wallet.

- Enhanced Privacy: There is no way for someone else to determine that two addresses are generated from the same master derivation key. This provides a potential avenue for applications to implement anonymous spending for end users without requiring users to store multiple passphrases.

### Reasons not to use kmd

- Resource Intensive: Using kmd requires running a process and storing keys on a disk. If you do not have access to a node or you require a more lightweight solution, [Standalone Accounts](#standalone) may be a better-suited option.

### How to use kmd

#### Start the kmd process

To initiate the kmd process and generate the required `kmd.net` and `kmd.token` files use [`goal kmd`](/nodes/reference/artifacts#goal) or [`kmd`](/nodes/reference/artifacts#kmd) command line utilities.

Start kmd using goal with a 3600-second timeout.

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
$ goal kmd start -t 3600
Successfully started kmd
```

Kmd can directly be used using the following command

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
$ kmd -d data/kmd-v<version>/ -t 3600
```

Once the kmd has started, retrieve the kmd IP address and access token:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
$ echo "kmd IP address: " `cat $ALGORAND_DATA/kmd-v<version>/kmd.net
kmd IP address:  [ip-address]:[port]

$ echo "kmd token: " `cat $ALGORAND_DATA/kmd-v<version>/kmd.token
kmd token:  [token]
```

#### Create a wallet and generate an account

Wallet and account can be created using different ways.

##### Using goal

Following are the commands to create a new wallet and a generate an account using goal,

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
$ goal wallet new testwallet
Please choose a password for wallet 'testwallet':
Please confirm the password:
Creating wallet...
Created wallet 'testwallet'
Your new wallet has a backup phrase that can be used for recovery.
Keeping this backup phrase safe is extremely important.
Would you like to see it now? (Y/n): y
Your backup phrase is printed below.
Keep this information safe -- never share it with anyone!

[25-word mnemonic]

$ goal account new
Created new account with address [address]
```

##### Using utils

- KMD client based Account Creation: We can also use the utils to create a wallet and account with the KMD client.

#### Recover wallet and regenerate account

To recover a wallet and any previously generated accounts, use the wallet backup phrase (also called the wallet mnemonic or passphrase). The master derivation key for the wallet will always generate the same addresses in the same order. Therefore the process of recovering an account within the wallet looks exactly like generating a new account.

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
$ goal wallet new -r <recovered-wallet-name>
Please type your recovery mnemonic below, and hit return when you are done:
[25-word wallet mnemonic]
Please choose a password for wallet [RECOVERED_WALLET_NAME]:
Please confirm the password:
Creating wallet...
Created wallet [RECOVERED_WALLET_NAME]

$ goal account new -w <recovered-wallet-name>
Created new account with address [RECOVERED_ADDRESS]
```

:::note
An offline wallet may not accurately reflect account balances, but the state for those accounts (e.g. its balance, online status) is safely stored on the blockchain. kmd will repopulate those balances when connected to a node.
:::

:::caution
For compatibility with other developer tools, `goal` provides functions to import and export accounts into kmd wallets, however, keep in mind that an imported account can not be recovered/derived from the wallet-level mnemonic. You must always keep track of the account-level mnemonics that you import into kmd wallets.

#### HD Wallets

Algorand's Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet implementation, based on the ARC-0052 standard, enables the creation of multiple accounts from a single master seed. The API implementations are in TypeScript, Kotlin, and Swift, providing a consistent and efficient solution for managing multiple accounts with a single mnemonic.

HD wallets are especially beneficial for applications that require streamlined account generation and enhanced privacy. By using this approach, developers can ensure all accounts are deterministically derived from a single seed phrase, making wallet management more convenient for both users and applications.
