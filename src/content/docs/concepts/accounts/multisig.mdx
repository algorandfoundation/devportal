Multisignature accounts, are a logical representation of an ordered set of addresses with a threshold and version. The version is a parameter that specifies the multisignature protocol version being used. Multisignature accounts can perform the same operations as other accounts, including sending transactions and participating in consensus. The address for a multisignature account is essentially a hash of the ordered list of accounts, the threshold and version values. The threshold determines how many signatures are required to process any transaction from this multisignature account.

Multisignature accounts cannot nest other multisignature accounts.

Creating a multisignature account with Address A, Address B, and Address C will not produce the same address as one with Address B, Address A, and Address C. However, signing a multisignature transaction does not require any specific order. You can use the fact that order matters to generate multiple addresses that can be signed by the same set of keys.

[Send Algos](/concepts/accounts/funding) to the address to initialize its state on the blockchain as you would any other address.

## Benefits of Using Multisig Accounts

- Enhanced Security: Requires multiple signatures for transactions, adding an extra layer of security.
- Customizable Authorization: The number of required signatures can be adjusted to fit different security models.
- Distributed Key Storage: Signing keys can be stored separately and generated through different methods (kmd, standalone accounts, or a mix).
- Governance Mechanisms: Enables cryptographically secure governance structures where multiple users control an account and spending is authorized by a subset of those users.
- Integration with Smart Contracts: Can be paired with Algorand Smart Contracts for complex governance models requiring specific signature subsets.

## Implications of Using Multisig Accounts

- Reduced Convenience: Requires multiple signatures for every transaction, adding complexity.
- Unnecessary for Simple Use Cases: If security and governance are not critical, a single-signature account may be more practical.

## How to Generate a Multisig Account

There are different ways to generate a multisig account. The following example demonstrates how to create a multisignature account using AlgoKit Utils and also using goal, which simplifies multisig account creation and transaction signing in TypeScript. In this example, only 2 signatures from the 3 possible signers to authorize transactions. The multisig account is then funded using a developer-managed dispenser, ensuring it has sufficient Algos for transactions. Finally, a payment transaction is sent from the multisig account, and AlgoKit Utils automatically gathers the required signatures from the provided signers, streamlining the signing process.
