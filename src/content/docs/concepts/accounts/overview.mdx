An Algorand Account is a fundamental entity on the Algorand blockchain, representing an individual user or entity capable of holding assets, authorizing transactions, and participating in blockchain activities. Accounts on the Algorand blockchain serve several purposes, including managing balances of Algos, interacting with smart contracts, and holding Algorand Standard Assets.

An Algorand account is the foundation of user interaction on the Algorand blockchain. It starts with the creation of a cryptographic key pair:

- A private key, which must be kept secret as it is used to sign transactions and prove ownership of the account.
- A public key, which acts as the account’s unique identity on the blockchain and is shared publicly as its address.

The public key is transformed into a user-friendly Algorand address — a 58-character string you use for transactions and other blockchain interactions. For convenience, the private key can also be represented as a 25-word mnemonic, which serves as a human-readable backup for restoring account access. Refer to [Keys and Signing](/concepts/accounts/keys-signing) to understand on how transformation happened from public key to algorand address.

An address is just an identifier, while an account represents the full state and capabilities on the blockchain. An address is always associated with one account, but an account can have multiple addresses through rekeying.

## Account Types:

Algorand accounts fall into two broad categories: Standard Accounts and Smart Contract Accounts.

- Normal accounts - Single signer, multisig
- Smart contract accounts - Logic sig, application accounts
-

## Standard Accounts

### Single Signature Accounts

Accounts are entities on the Algorand blockchain associated with specific on-chain data, like a balance. An Algorand Address is the identifier for an Algorand account. todo -check: These are the most common type, controlled by a private key, allowing users to sign transactions and interact with the blockchain.

After generating a private key and corresponding address, sending Algos to the address on Algorand will initialize its state on the Algorand blockchain.

#### Attributes

##### Minimum Balance

Every account on Algorand must have a minimum balance of 100,000 microAlgos. If a transaction is sent that would result in a balance lower than the minimum, the transaction will fail. The minimum balance increases with each asset holding the account whether the asset was created or owned by the account and with each application, the account created or opted in. Destroying a created asset, opting out/closing out an owned asset, destroying a created app, or opting out of an opted-in app decreases the minimum balance accordingly.

##### Account Status

todo - check this once
The Algorand blockchain uses a decentralized Byzantine Agreement protocol that leverages pure proof of stake (Pure POS). By default, Algorand accounts are set to offline, meaning they do not contribute to the consensus process. An online account participates in Algorand consensus. For an account to go online, it must generate a participation key and send a special key registration transaction. With the addition of staking rewards into the protocol as of v4.0, Algorand consensus participants can set their account as eligible for rewards by including a 2 Algo fee when registering participation keys online. Read more about [Registering an account online](/protocol/registration).

#### Other Attributes

### Logic Accounts

Logic accounts are signed by their logic instead of signing with private keys.

So when a logic account sends a transaction, the blockchain checks for the logic, if the logic passes the transaction will succeed. These accounts differ in how they authorize spending, but they look like any other account on Algorand.

### Multisignature Accounts

accounts enhance security by requiring multiple authorized signers to validate transactions. They are created from a predefined set of accounts, with a required signature threshold e.g., X out of N signers. These accounts have all the features of standard accounts.

## Smart Contract Accounts

### Smart Signature Accounts (Contract Accounts):

These accounts do not have a private key. Instead, transactions are approved only if they satisfy predefined logic, which is evaluated at submission. These accounts are stateless and cannot store data persistently. They have limited access to on-chain data—only transaction parameters and specific read-only blockchain properties are available during execution. The logic is stored off-chain and provided at execution time.

Smart Signature Accounts are Algorand accounts controlled by TEAL logic instead of private keys. Each unique compiled smart signature program corresponds to a single Algorand address, enabling it to function as an independent account when funded. These accounts authorize transactions based on predefined TEAL logic rather than user signatures, allowing them to hold Algos and Algorand Standard Assets. Since they are stateless, they do not maintain on-chain data between transactions, making them ideal for lightweight, logic-based transaction approvals. However, its recommended to use use smart signatures only when absolutely required as smart signatures require the logic to be supplied for every transaction.

### Application Accounts( Smart Contracts):

These are created when an application is deployed on Algorand and persist on the network indefinitely.

### Special Accounts

The following accounts carry special meaning on the Algorand blockchain:

- FeeSink: is where all transaction fees are sent. This account can only be spent on the RewardsPool account. Check the fee sink addresses in [Network](/protocol/networks) section to know more.

- RewardsPool: was first used to distribute rewards to balance-holding accounts. Currently, this account is not in use. Check the reward pool addresses in [Network](/protocol/networks) section to know more.

- Algorand also has ZeroAddress `AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY5HFKQ` which represents a blank byte array and is used when an address field is left blank in a transaction. It is also used in configuring assets and signifies an irretrievable destination—any Algos sent to this address can never be recovered. Additionally, the ZeroAddress cannot opt into Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs) or applications because it cannot sign transactions.

### HD Wallets

Hierarchical Deterministic wallets, following the ARC-0052 standard, provide an advanced method for key management. HD wallets derive keys deterministically from a single master seed, ensuring consistent addresses across different implementations. Using the Ed25519 algorithm for key generation and signing, they support BIP-44 derivation paths.
It allows private key and mnemonic-based account generation, enabling deterministic recovery, automated address creation, and compatibility with Algorand’s address formats.

### Wallets

In Algorand, a wallet is a system for generating, storing, and managing private keys that control accounts.

- Key Management Daemon (KMD) Wallets – Managed by Algorand’s Key Management Daemon (kmd), these wallets store multiple accounts and allow signing transactions securely. Each wallet is protected by a 25-word mnemonic, from which all accounts are derived. Wallets are encrypted and stored on disk.
- Third-Party Wallets – Developers can integrate with non-custodial wallets like Pera Wallet, Defly, and Ledger hardware wallets, which support Algorand’s transaction signing.

In the context of Algorand developer tools, wallets refer to wallets generated and managed by the Key Management Daemon process. A wallet stores a collection of keys. kmd stores collections of wallets and allows users to perform operations using the keys stored within these wallets. Every wallet is associated with a master key, represented as a 25-word mnemonic, from which all accounts in that wallet are derived. This allows the wallet owner only to need to remember a single passphrase for all of their accounts. Wallets are stored encrypted on disk.
