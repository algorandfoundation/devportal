Rekeying is a powerful protocol feature that enables an Algorand account holder to maintain a static public address while dynamically rotating the authoritative private spending key(s). This is accomplished by issuing a transaction with the `rekey-to` field set the authorized address field within the account object. Future transaction authorization using the account's public address must be provided by the spending key(s) associated with the authorized address, which may be a single key address, multisignature address, or logic signature program address. Rekeying an account only affects the authorizing address for that account. An account is distinct from an address, so several essential points may not be obvious:

- If an account is closed (balance to 0), the rekey setting is lost.
- Rekeys are not recursively resolved. If A is rekeyed to B and B rekeyed to C, B will authorize A's transactions, not C.
- Rekeying members of a multisignature does not affect the multisignature authorization since it's composed of Addresses, not accounts. If necessary, the multisignature account would need to be rekeyed.

The result of a confirmed `rekey-to` transaction will be the `auth-addr` field of the account object is defined, modified, or removed. Defining or modifying means only the corresponding authorized address's private spending key(s) may authorize future transactions for this public address. Removing the `auth-addr` field is an explicit assignment of the authorized address back to the “addr" field of the account object (observed implicitly because the field is not displayed).

To provide maximum flexibility in key management options, the `auth-addr` may be specified within a `rekey-to` transaction as a distinct foreign address representing a single key address, multisignature address, or logic signature program address. The protocol does not validate control of the required spending key(s) associated with the authorized address defined by `--rekey-to` parameter when the `rekey-to` transaction is sent. This is by design and affords additional privacy features to the new authorized address. It is incumbent upon the user to ensure proper key management practices and `--rekey-to` assignments.

:::caution
Using the `--close-to` parameter on any transaction from a rekeyed account will remove the `auth-addr` field, thus reverting signing authority to the original address. The `--close-to` parameter should be used with caution by keyholder(s) of `auth-addr` as the effects remove their authority to access this account thereafter.

## Authorized Addresses

The balance record of every account includes the `auth-addr` field, which, when populated, defines the required authorized address to be evaluated during transaction validation. Initially, the `auth-addr` field is implicitly set to the account’s `address` field, and the only valid private spending key is created during account generation. The `auth-addr` field is only stored and displayed to conserve resources after the network confirms an authorized `rekey-to` transaction.

A `standard` account uses its private spending key to authorize from its public address. A `rekeyed` account defines the authorized address that references a distinct `foreign` address and thus requires the private spending key(s) thereof to authorize future transactions.

Let's consider a scenario where a single-key account with address `A` rekeys to a different single-key account with address `B`. This requires two single key accounts at time t0. The result from time t1 is that transactions for address `A` must be authorized by address `B`.

<Figure src={rekeySingleSingle} alt='Figure: Rekeying to a Single Address' />

Refer to [Creating Accounts](/concepts/accounts/create) to generate two accounts and [Funding Accounts](/concepts/accounts/funding) to fund their addresses using the faucet. This example utilizes the following public addresses:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
ADDR_A="UGAGADYHIUGFGRBEPHXRFI6Z73HUFZ25QP32P5FV4H6B3H3DS2JII5ZF3Q"
ADDR_B="LOWE5DE25WOXZB643JSNWPE6MGIJNBLRPU2RBAVUNI4ZU22E3N7PHYYHSY"
```

Use the following code sample to view initial authorized address for Account `A` using `goal`:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal account dump --address $ADDR_A
```

Response:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
{
    "addr": "UGAGADYHIUGFGRBEPHXRFI6Z73HUFZ25QP32P5FV4H6B3H3DS2JII5ZF3Q",
    "algo": 100000,
    [...]
}
```

The response includes the `addr` field, which is the public address. Only the spending key associated with this address may authorize transactions for this account.

Now lets consider another scenario wherein a single key account with public address `A` rekeys to a multi signature address `BC_T1`. This scenario reuses both Accounts `A` and `B`, adds a third Account `C` and creates a multisignature Account `BC_T1` comprised of addresses `B` and `C` with a threshold of 1. The result will be the private spending key for `$ADDR_B` or `$ADDR_C` may authorize transaction from `$ADDR_A`.

<Image src={rekeySingleMulti} alt='Rekey to multisignature Address' />

To create a new multisignature account, refer to [Generate a Multisignature Account](/concepts/accounts/multisig). Ensure it uses both `$ADDR_B` and the new `$ADDR_C` with a threshold of 1 (so either `B` or `C` may authorize). Set the resulting account address to the `$ADDR_BC_T1` environment variable for use below.

## Rekey-to Transaction

A `rekey-to` transaction allows an account holder to change the spending authority of their account without changing the account's public address. A rekey-to transaction enables an account owner to delegate their spending authority to a different private key while maintaining the same public address. This means the original account can transfer its authorization to sign and approve transactions to a new key without creating a new account or changing the account's address. The existing authorized address must provide authorization for this transaction.

Account `A` intends to rekey its authorized address to `$ADDR_B,` which is the public address of Account `B`. This can be accomplished in a single `goal` command:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal clerk send --from $ADDR_A --to $ADDR_A --amount 0 --rekey-to $ADDR_B
```

Now, if we view account `A` using the command:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal account dump --address $ADDR_A
```

Response:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
{
    "addr": "UGAGADYHIUGFGRBEPHXRFI6Z73HUFZ25QP32P5FV4H6B3H3DS2JII5ZF3Q",
    "algo": 199000,
    [...]
    "spend": "LOWE5DE25WOXZB643JSNWPE6MGIJNBLRPU2RBAVUNI4ZU22E3N7PHYYHSY"
}
```

The populated `spend` field instructs the validation protocol to only approve transactions for this account object when authorized by that address's spending key(s). Validators will ignore all other attempted authorizations, including those from the public address defined in the `addr` field.

The following transaction will fail because, by default, `goal` attempts to add the authorization using the `--from` parameter. However, the protocol will reject this because it is expecting the authorization from `$ADDR_B` due to the confirmed rekeying transaction above.

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal clerk send --from $ADDR_A --to $ADDR_B --amount 100000
```

The rekey-to transaction workflow is as follows:

- Construct a transaction that specifies an address for the rekey-to parameter
- Add the required signature(s) from the current authorized address
- Send and confirm the transaction on the network

### Construct an Unsigned Transaction

We will construct an unsigned transaction using `goal` with the `--outfile` flag to write the unsigned transaction to a file:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal clerk send --from $ADDR_A --to $ADDR_B --amount 100000 --out send-single.txn
```

For multisignature account, the rekey transaction constructed requires authorization from `$ADDR_B`.

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal clerk send --from $ADDR_A --to $ADDR_A --amount 0 --rekey-to $ADDR_BC_T1 --out rekey-multisig.txn
```

### Add Authorized Signature(s)

Next, locate the wallet containing the private spending key for Account `B`. The `goal clerk sign` command provides the flag `--signer`, which specifies the proper required authorized address `$ADDR_B`. Notice the `infile` flag reads in the unsigned transaction file from above and the `--outfile` flag writes the signed transaction to a separate file.

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal clerk sign --signer $ADDR_B --infile send-single.txn --outfile send-single.stxn
```

Use the following command to sign rekey transaction in multisignature account:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal clerk sign --signer $ADDR_B --infile rekey-multisig.txn --outfile rekey-multisig.stxn
```

### Send and Confirm

We will send the signed transaction file using the following command:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal clerk rawsend --filename send-single.stxn
```

This will succeed, sending the 100000 microAlgos from `$ADDR_A` to `$ADDR_B` using the private spending key of Account `B`.

Next, send and Confirm Rekey to multisignature account using the following command:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal clerk rawsend --filename rekey-multisig.stxn
goal account dump --address $ADDR_A
```

The rekey transaction will confirm, resulting in the `spend` field update within the account object:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
{
  "addr": "UGAGADYHIUGFGRBEPHXRFI6Z73HUFZ25QP32P5FV4H6B3H3DS2JII5ZF3Q",
  "algo": 199000,
  [...]
 "spend": "NEWMULTISIGADDRESSBCT1..."
}
```

Now we will send with `Auth BC_T1` using the following command:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal clerk send --from $ADDR_A --to $ADDR_B --amount 100000 --msig-params="1 $ADDR_B $ADDR_C" --out send-multisig-bct1.txn
goal clerk multisig sign --tx send-multisig-bct1.txn --address $ADDR_C
goal clerk rawsend --filename send-multisig-bct1.txn
```

This transaction will succeed as a private spending key for `$ADDR_C` provided the authorization and meets the threshold requirement for the multisignature account.

## Utils Example

Rekeying can also be acheived using Algokit Utils. In the following example, account_a is rekeyed to account_b. The code then illustrates that signing a transaction from account_a will fail if signed with account_a’s private key and succeed if signed with account_b’s private key.
