Rekeying is a powerful protocol feature that enables an Algorand account holder to maintain a static public address while dynamically rotating the authoritative private spending key(s). This is accomplished by issuing a transaction with the rekey-to field set the authorized address field within the account object. Future transaction authorization using the account's public address must be provided by the spending key(s) associated with the authorized address, which may be a single key address, MultiSig address, or LogicSig program address. The term “spending key(s)” is used throughout this document to signify that a single key or a set of keys from a MultiSig account may be authorized from a given public address. The address itself cannot distinguish how many spending keys are specifically required.

Rekeying an account only affects the authorizing address for that account. Note that an Account is distinct from an address, so several essential points may not be obvious:

1. If an account is closed (balance to 0), the rekey setting is lost (see previous caution).
2. Rekeys are not recursively resolved. If A is rekeyed to B and B rekeyed to C, B will authorize A's transactions, not C.
3. Rekeying members of a Multisig does not affect the Multisig authorization since it's composed of Addresses, not accounts. If necessary, the Multisig account would need to be rekeyed.

:::caution
Using the `--close-to` parameter on any transaction from a rekeyed account will remove the auth-addr field, thus reverting signing authority to the original address. The `--close-to` parameter should be used with caution by keyholder(s) of auth-addr as the effects remove their authority to access this account thereafter.
:::

The result of a confirmed rekey-to transaction will be the "auth-addr" field of the account object is defined, modified, or removed. Defining or modifying means only the corresponding authorized address's private spending key(s) may authorize future transactions for this public address. Removing the "auth-addr" field is an explicit assignment of the authorized address back to the “addr" field of the account object (observed implicitly because the field is not displayed).

To provide maximum flexibility in key management options, the "auth-addr" may be specified within a rekey-to transaction as a distinct foreign address representing a single key address, MultiSig address, or LogicSig program address. The protocol does not validate control of the required spending key(s) associated with the authorized address defined by `--rekey-to` parameter when the rekey-to transaction is sent. This is by design and affords additional privacy features to the new authorized address. It is incumbent upon the user to ensure proper key management practices and `--rekey-to` assignments.

## Account Review

The [keys and signing](/concepts/accounts/keys-signing) page introduces keys, addresses, and accounts. During initial account generation, a public key and corresponding private spending key are created to derive the Algorand address. This public address is commonly displayed within wallet software and remains static for each account. When you receive Algo or other assets, they will be sent to your public Algorand address. When you send from your account, the transaction must be authorized using the appropriate private spending key(s).

## Authorized Addresses

The balance record of every account includes the “auth-addr” field, which, when populated, defines the required authorized address to be evaluated during transaction validation. Initially, the “auth-addr” field is implicitly set to the account’s “address" field, and the only valid private spending key is created during account generation. The "auth-addr” field is only stored and displayed to conserve resources after the network confirms an authorized rekey-to transaction.

Conceptually illustrated in the image below, a “standard" account uses its private spending key to authorize from its public address. A “rekeyed" account defines the authorized address that references a distinct "foreign” address and thus requires the private spending key(s) thereof to authorize future transactions.

<Image src={rekeyStandardAccount} alt='Rekey Standard Account' />

### Standard Account

Use the following code sample to view a standard account on BetaNet:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal account dump --address NFFMZJC6H52JLEAITTJ7OIML3XCJFKIRXYRJLO4WLWIJZB7N6CTWESRAZU`
```

Response:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
{
    "addr": "NFFMZJC6H52JLEAITTJ7OIML3XCJFKIRXYRJLO4WLWIJZB7N6CTWESRAZU",
    "algo": 100000,
    [...]
}
```

Notice that the response includes the “add" field, which is the public address. Only the spending key associated with this address may authorize transactions for this account.

### Rekeyed Account

Next, modify your command slightly to display results for this rekeyed account:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
L42DW7MSHP4PMIAZSDAXYTZVHTE756KGXCJYGFKCET5XHIAWLBYYNSMZQU
```

Response:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
{
    "addr": "L42DW7MSHP4PMIAZSDAXYTZVHTE756KGXCJYGFKCET5XHIAWLBYYNSMZQU",
    "algo": 100000,
    "spend": "NFFMZJC6H52JLEAITTJ7OIML3XCJFKIRXYRJLO4WLWIJZB7N6CTWESRAZU",
    [...]
}
```

This response includes the addition of the “spend" field. This is the “auth-addr" within the account object and signifies any transactions from `L42DW7MSHP4PMIAZSDAXYTZVHTE756KGXCJYGFKCET5XHIAWLBYYNSMZQU` must now be authorized by `NFFMZJC6H52JLEAITTJ7OIML3XCJFKIRXYRJLO4WLWIJZB7N6CTWESRAZU` to be confirmed by the network.

## Rekey-to Transaction

A rekey-to transaction is a transaction that includes the `rekey-to` parameter set to a well-formed Algorand address. The existing authorized address must provide authorization for this transaction. As shown in the first example account above, the authorized address is implicitly the “addr” field of this account even though the "auth-addr” field is not explicitly defined. Only the private spending key of this “addr” address may be used to authorize a rekey-to transaction.

The rekey-to transaction workflow is as follows:

Construct a transaction that specifies an address for the `rekey-to` parameter  
 Add the required signature(s) from the current authorized address  
 Send and confirm the transaction on the network

### Construct Transaction

The following commands will construct an unsigned transaction file `rekey.txn` and inspect the contents:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal clerk send --from L42DW7MSHP4PMIAZSDAXYTZVHTE756KGXCJYGFKCET5XHIAWLBYYNSMZQU \
                  --to L42DW7MSHP4PMIAZSDAXYTZVHTE756KGXCJYGFKCET5XHIAWLBYYNSMZQU \
                  --amount 0 \
                  --rekey-to NFFMZJC6H52JLEAITTJ7OIML3XCJFKIRXYRJLO4WLWIJZB7N6CTWESRAZU \
                  --out rekey.txn
goal clerk inspect rekey.txn
```

Response:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
rekey.txn[0]
{
  "txn": {
    "fee": 1000,
    "fv": 4921687,
    "gen": "betanet-v1.0",
    "gh": "mFgazF+2uRS1tMiL9dsj01hJGySEmPN28B/TjjvpVW0=",
    "lv": 4922687,
    "note": "bbD6hjNZNdg=",
    "rcv": "L42DW7MSHP4PMIAZSDAXYTZVHTE756KGXCJYGFKCET5XHIAWLBYYNSMZQU",
   "rekey": "NFFMZJC6H52JLEAITTJ7OIML3XCJFKIRXYRJLO4WLWIJZB7N6CTWESRAZU",
   "snd": "L42DW7MSHP4PMIAZSDAXYTZVHTE756KGXCJYGFKCET5XHIAWLBYYNSMZQU",
    "type": "pay"
  }
}
```

Construction of the rekey-to transaction includes the `rekey-to` parameter and the value `"NFFMZJC6H52JLEAITTJ7OIML3XCJFKIRXYRJLO4WLWIJZB7N6CTWESRAZU"`. Notice the resulting unsigned transaction output includes the "rekey" field and this value.

### Add Authorized Signature(s)

Adding the currently authorized signature(s) to a rekey-to transaction is required before sending it to the network for confirmation. The “snd" field provides the address to the account object where the "auth-addr” field is defined.

:::note
The examples provided below demonstrate the commands in detail and allow you to rekey accounts in various scenarios.
:::

### Send and Confirm

Once all required signatures are gathered into a single signed transaction, it may be sent to the network for confirmation. The result for the sample account is as follows:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
{
    "addr": "L42DW7MSHP4PMIAZSDAXYTZVHTE756KGXCJYGFKCET5XHIAWLBYYNSMZQU",
    "algo": 100000,
    "spend": "NFFMZJC6H52JLEAITTJ7OIML3XCJFKIRXYRJLO4WLWIJZB7N6CTWESRAZU",
    [...]
}
```

## Use Case Scenarios

Below are a series of potential use cases for rekeying various accounts.

### 1 \- Rekey to Single Address

The first scenario rekeys a single key account with address “A” to a distinct single key account with address "B.” This requires two single key accounts at time t0. The result from time t1 is that transactions for address “A” must be authorized by address "B.”

<Image src={rekeySingleSingle} alt='Rekey to Single Address' />

#### Generate and Fund Accounts

Refer to the Getting Started guide to learn how to generate two accounts and fund their respective address from the Faucet. This example uses the following public addresses:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
ADDR_A="UGAGADYHIUGFGRBEPHXRFI6Z73HUFZ25QP32P5FV4H6B3H3DS2JII5ZF3Q"
ADDR_B="LOWE5DE25WOXZB643JSNWPE6MGIJNBLRPU2RBAVUNI4ZU22E3N7PHYYHSY"
```

View the initial authorized address for Account A using `goal`:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal account dump --address $ADDR_A
```

Response:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
{
    "addr": "UGAGADYHIUGFGRBEPHXRFI6Z73HUFZ25QP32P5FV4H6B3H3DS2JII5ZF3Q",
    "algo": 100000,
    [...]
}
```

The authorized address is defined as the “addr” field displayed here.

#### Rekey to Single Address

Account A intends to rekey its authorized address to `$ADDR_B,` which is the public address of Account “B”. This can be accomplished in a single `goal` command:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal clerk send --from $ADDR_A --to $ADDR_A --amount 0 --rekey-to $ADDR_B
```

Results of

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal account dump --address $ADDR_A
```

will now display:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
{
    "addr": "UGAGADYHIUGFGRBEPHXRFI6Z73HUFZ25QP32P5FV4H6B3H3DS2JII5ZF3Q",
    "algo": 199000,
    [...]
    "spend": "LOWE5DE25WOXZB643JSNWPE6MGIJNBLRPU2RBAVUNI4ZU22E3N7PHYYHSY"
}
```

The populated "spend" field instructs the validation protocol to only approve transactions for this account object when authorized by that address's spending key(s). Validators will ignore all other attempted authorizations, including those from the public address defined in the "addr” field.

##### TEST: Send with Auth A

The following transaction will fail because, by default, `goal` attempts to add the authorization using the `--from` parameter. However, the protocol will reject this because it is expecting the authorization from `$ADDR_B` due to the confirmed rekeying transaction above.

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal clerk send --from $ADDR_A --to $ADDR_B --amount 100000
```

#### Send from the Authorized Address

Sending from the authorized address of Account "A" requires:

Construct an unsigned transaction from `$ADDR_A`  
 Sign using authorized address `$ADDR_B`  
 Send authorized transaction

##### Construct Unsigned Transaction

First, construct an unsigned transaction using `goal` with the `--outfile` flag to write the unsigned transaction to a file:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal clerk send --from $ADDR_A --to $ADDR_B --amount 100000 --out send-single.txn
```

##### Sign Using Authorized Address

Next, locate the wallet containing the private spending key for Account "B". The `goal clerk sign` command provides the flag `--signer`, which specifies the proper required authorized address `$ADDR_B`. Notice the `infile` flag reads in the unsigned transaction file from above and the `--outfile` flag writes the signed transaction to a separate file.

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal clerk sign --signer $ADDR_B --infile send-single.txn --outfile send-single.stxn
```

##### TEST: Send with Auth B

Finally, send the the signed transaction file using `goal`:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal clerk rawsend --filename send-single.stxn
```

This will succeed, sending the 100000 microAlgos from `$ADDR_A` to `$ADDR_B` using the private spending key of Account "B".

### 2 \- Rekey to MultiSig Address

The second scenario rekeys a single key account with public address "A" to a MultiSig address "BC_T1". This scenario reuses both Accounts "A" and "B", adds a third Account "C" and creates a MultiSig Account "BC_T1" comprised of addresses "B" and "C" with a threshold of 1\. The result will be the private spending key for `$ADDR_B` or `$ADDR_C` may authorize transaction from `$ADDR_A`.

<Image src={rekeySingleMulti} alt='Rekey to MultiSig Address' />

#### Generate Additional Account

Follow the same procedure as above to generate a third account for use as "C".

#### Generate a New MultiSig Account

Reference the documentation to generate a MultiSig account. Ensure it uses both `$ADDR_B` and the new `$ADDR_C` with a threshold of 1 (so either “B" or "C” may authorize). Set the resulting account address to the `$ADDR_BC_T1` environment variable for use below.

#### Rekey to MultiSig Address

Recall from scenario 1 that Account "A" has already rekeyed to `$ADDR_B`.

#### Construct Unsigned Transaction

The rekey transaction constructed for this scenario requires authorization from `$ADDR_B`.

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal clerk send --from $ADDR_A --to $ADDR_A --amount 0 --rekey-to $ADDR_BC_T1 --out rekey-multisig.txn
```

#### Sign Rekey Transaction

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal clerk sign --signer $ADDR_B --infile rekey-multisig.txn --outfile rekey-multisig.stxn
```

#### Send and Confirm Rekey to MultiSig

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal clerk rawsend --filename rekey-multisig.stxn
goal account dump --address $ADDR_A
```

The rekey transaction will confirm, resulting in the "spend" field update within the account object:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
{
  "addr": "UGAGADYHIUGFGRBEPHXRFI6Z73HUFZ25QP32P5FV4H6B3H3DS2JII5ZF3Q",
  "algo": 199000,
  [...]
 "spend": "NEWMULTISIGADDRESSBCT1..."
}
```

##### TEST: Send with Auth BC_T1

Use the established pattern:

Construct unsigned transaction  
 Sign transaction  
 Confirm transaction

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
goal clerk send --from $ADDR_A --to $ADDR_B --amount 100000 --msig-params="1 $ADDR_B $ADDR_C" --out send-multisig-bct1.txn
goal clerk multisig sign --tx send-multisig-bct1.txn --address $ADDR_C
goal clerk rawsend --filename send-multisig-bct1.txn
```

This transaction will succeed as a private spending key for `$ADDR_C` provided the authorization and meets the threshold requirement for the MultiSig account.

### Utils Example

In the following example, account_a is rekeyed to account_b. The code then illustrates that signing a transaction from account_a will fail if signed with account_a’s private key and succeed if signed with Aaccount_b’s private key.
