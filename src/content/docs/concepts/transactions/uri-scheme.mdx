title: URI Scheme
---

The Algorand URI specification defines a standardized format for applications and websites to encode transaction requests and wallet information in URIs. These URIs can be used in deeplinks, QR codes, and other interfaces. The specification is based on Bitcoin's [BIP-0021](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0021.mediawiki) to maintain familiarity and compatibility with existing systems.

## Specifications

### General format

Algorand URIs follow the general format for URIs specified in RFC 3986. The path component consists of an Algorand address, and the query component provides additional payment options.

Elements of the query component may contain characters outside the valid range. These must first be encoded according to UTF-8, and then each octet of the corresponding UTF-8 sequence must be percent-encoded as described in RFC 3986.

### ABNF Grammar

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
algorandurn     = "algorand://" algorandaddress [ "?" algorandparams ]
algorandaddress = *base32
algorandparams  = algorandparam [ "&" algorandparams ]
algorandparam   = [ amountparam / labelparam / noteparam / assetparam / otherparam ]
amountparam     = "amount=" *digit
labelparam      = "label=" *qchar
assetparam      = "asset=" *digit
noteparam       = (xnote | note)
xnote           = "xnote=" *qchar
note            = "note=" *qchar
otherparam      = qchar *qchar [ "=" *qchar ]
```

Here, `qchar` corresponds to valid characters of an RFC 3986 URI query component, excluding the `=` and `&` characters, which this specification takes as separators.

The scheme component `algorand:` is case-insensitive, and implementations must accept any combination of uppercase and lowercase letters. The rest of the URI is case-sensitive, including the query parameter keys.

:::note
When it comes to generation of an address' QR, many exchanges and wallets encodes the address w/o the scheme component (“algorand:”). This is not a URI so it is OK.

### Query Keys

- **`label`**: Label for that address (e.g. name of receiver)

- **`address`**: Algorand address (if missing, sender address will be used as receiver.)

- **`xnote`**: A URL-encoded notes field value that must not be modifiable by the user when displayed to users.

- **`note`**: A URL-encoded default notes field value that the the user interface may optionally make editable by the user.

- **`amount`**: microAlgo or smallest unit of asset

- **`asset`**: The asset id this request refers to (if Algo, simply omit this parameter)

- **`otherparam`**: optional, for future extensions

### Transfer Amount/Size

If an amount is provided, it MUST be specified in the basic unit of the asset. For example, if it's Algo (Algorand's native token), the amount MUST be specified in microAlgo. All amounts MUST be non-negative integers and MUST NOT contain commas or decimal points.

Examples:

- 100 Algo = 100000000 microAlgo
- 54.1354 Algo = 54135400 microAlgo

Algorand clients should display amounts in whole Algo by default. When needed, microAlgo can be shown as well, but the units must always be clearly indicated to the user.

:::note
This behavior differs from Bitcoin's BIP-0021 specification

## Appendix

This section contains several examples

- Address

  ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
  algorand://TMTAD6N22HCS2LKH7677L2KFLT3PAQWY6M4JFQFXQS32ECBFC23F57RYX4
  ```

- Address with label

  ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
  algorand://TMTAD6N22HCS2LKH7677L2KFLT3PAQWY6M4JFQFXQS32ECBFC23F57RYX4?label=Silvio
  ```

- Request 150.5 Algo from an address

  ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
  algorand://TMTAD6N22HCS2LKH7677L2KFLT3PAQWY6M4JFQFXQS32ECBFC23F57RYX4?amount=150500000
  ```

- Request 150 units of Asset ID 45 from an address

  ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
  algorand://TMTAD6N22HCS2LKH7677L2KFLT3PAQWY6M4JFQFXQS32ECBFC23F57RYX4?amount=150&asset=45
  ```

- Opt-in request for Asset ID 37

  ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
  algorand://?amount=0&asset=37
  ```
