The ABI (Application Binary Interface) is a specification that defines the encoding/decoding of data types and a standard for exposing and invoking methods in a smart contract.

The specification is defined in [ARC4](/arc-standards/arc-0004).

At a high level, the ABI allows contracts to define an API with rich types and offer an interface description so clients know exactly what the contract is expecting to be passed.

## Data Types

In Algorand ABI (ARC-4), each data type has a precise encoding scheme, ensuring that contracts and client applications can seamlessly exchange information without ambiguity.
It's crutial to understand how these types - such as integers, strings, arrays, addresses, and more — are structured and its respective representation.

Keep in mind that the [AVM](/concepts/smart-contracts/avm) only reads `uint64` and `bytes`, usually the convertion of data types to these main two is handled under the hood by [Algorand Python](/concepts/smart-contracts/languages/python), [Algorand Typescript](1/concepts/smart-contracts/languages/typescript) and [Algokit Utils](/algokit/algokit-intro#algokit-utils).

This section describes how ABI types can be represented as byte strings.

| Type           | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| uintN          | An N-bit unsigned integer, where `8 <= N <= 512 and N % 8 = 0`                                                                                             |
| byte           | An alias for uint8                                                                                                                                         |
| bool           | A boolean value that is restricted to either 0 or 1. When encoded, up to 8 consecutive bool values will be packed into a single byte                       |
| ufixedNxM      | An N-bit unsigned fixed-point decimal number with precision M, where `8 <= N <= 512, N % 8 = 0, and 0 < M <= 160`, which denotes a value `v as v / (10^M)` |
| type[N]        | A fixed-length array of length `N, where N >= 0`. type can be any other type                                                                               |
| address        | Used to represent a 32-byte Algorand address. This is equivalent to byte[32]                                                                               |
| type[]         | A variable-length array. type can be any other type                                                                                                        |
| string         | A variable-length byte array (`byte[]`) assumed to contain UTF-8 encoded content                                                                           |
| (T1,T2,...,TN) | A tuple of the types `T1, T2, …, TN, N >= 0`                                                                                                               |
| reference type | account, asset, application only for arguments, in which case they are an alias for uint8. See section "Reference Types" below                             |

Encoding for the data types is specified [here](/arc-standards/arc-0004#encoding).

### Reference Types

Reference types may be specified in the method signature referring to some transaction parameters that must be passed. The value encoded is a uint8 reference to the index of element in the relevant array (i.e. for account, the index in the foreign accounts array).
These types are:

- `account` - represents an Algorand account, stored in the Accounts array
- `asset` - represents an Algorand Standard Asset (ASA), stored in the Foreign Assets array
- `application` - represents an Algorand Application, stored in the Foreign Apps array

Usually the construction of these arrays and handling these reference types is also executed by the high-level language tools in Algorand and Algokit.

## Methods

Methods may be exposed by the smart contract and called by submitting an ApplicationCall transaction to the existing application id.

A _method signature_ is defined as a name, argument types, and return type. The stringified version is then hashed and the first 4 bytes are taken as a _method selector_.

For example:

A _method signature_ for an `add` method that takes 2 uint64s and returns 1 uint128:

```
Method signature: add(uint64,uint64)uint128
```

The string version of the _method signature_ is hashed and the first 4 bytes are its _method selector_:

```
SHA-512/256 hash (in hex): 8aa3b61f0f1965c3a1cbfa91d46b24e54c67270184ff89dc114e877b1753254a
Method selector (in hex): 8aa3b61f
```

Once the method selector is known, it is used in the smart contract logic to route to the appropriate logic that implements the `add` method.

The `method` pseudo-opcode can be used in a contract to do the above work and produce a _method selector_ given the _method signature_ string.

```
method "add(uint64,uint64)uint128"
```

### Implementing a Method

[Implementing a method](/arc-standards/arc-0004#implementing-a-method) is done by handling an ApplicationCall transaction where the first element matches its method selector and the subsequent elements are used by the logic in the method body.

The initial handling logic of the contract should route to the correct method given a match against the method selector passed and the known method selector of the application method.

The return value of the method _must_ be logged with the prefix `151f7c75` which is the result of `sha256("return")[:4]`. Only the last logged element with this prefix is considered the return value of this method call.

## Interfaces

An Interface is a logically grouped set of methods.
An Algorand Application implements an Interface if it supports all of the methods from that Interface.

For example, an Interface Calculator providing addition and subtraction of integer methods and an Interface NumberFormatting providing formatting methods for numbers into strings are likely to be used together.
Interface designers should ensure that all the methods in Calculator and NumberFormatting have distinct method selectors.

For example:

```json
{
  "name": "Calculator",
  "desc": "Interface for a basic calculator supporting additions and multiplications",
  "methods": [
    {
      "name": "add",
      "desc": "Calculate the sum of two 64-bit integers",
      "args": [
        { "type": "uint64", "name": "a", "desc": "The first term to add" },
        { "type": "uint64", "name": "b", "desc": "The second term to add" }
      ],
      "returns": { "type": "uint128", "desc": "The sum of a and b" }
    },
    {
      "name": "multiply",
      "desc": "Calculate the product of two 64-bit integers",
      "args": [
        { "type": "uint64", "name": "a", "desc": "The first factor to multiply" },
        { "type": "uint64", "name": "b", "desc": "The second factor to multiply" }
      ],
      "returns": { "type": "uint128", "desc": "The product of a and b" }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Contracts

A Contract is a declaration of what an Application implements. It includes the complete list of the methods implemented by the related Application. It is similar to an Interface, but it may include further details about the concrete implementation, as well as implementation-specific methods that do not belong to any Interface.
In addition to the set of methods from the Contract’s definition, a Contract may allow bare Application calls (zero arg application calls). The primary purpose of bare Application calls is to allow the execution of an OnCompletion actions which requires no inputs and has no return value such as NoOp, OptIn, CloseOut, UpdateApplication and DeleteApplication.

Here's an example of a contract implementation:

```json
{
  "name": "Calculator",
  "desc": "Contract of a basic calculator supporting additions and multiplications. Implements the Calculator interface.",
  "networks": {
    "wGHE2Pwdvd7S12BL5FaOP20EGYesN73ktiC1qzkkit8=": { "appID": 1234 },
    "SGO1GKSzyE7IEPItTxCByw9x8FmnrCDexi9/cOUJOiI=": { "appID": 5678 }
  },
  "methods": [
    {
      "name": "add",
      "desc": "Calculate the sum of two 64-bit integers",
      "args": [
        { "type": "uint64", "name": "a", "desc": "The first term to add" },
        { "type": "uint64", "name": "b", "desc": "The second term to add" }
      ],
      "returns": { "type": "uint128", "desc": "The sum of a and b" }
    },
    {
      "name": "multiply",
      "desc": "Calculate the product of two 64-bit integers",
      "args": [
        { "type": "uint64", "name": "a", "desc": "The first factor to multiply" },
        { "type": "uint64", "name": "b", "desc": "The second factor to multiply" }
      ],
      "returns": { "type": "uint128", "desc": "The product of a and b" }
    }
  ]
}
```

## API

The API of a smart contract can be published as an [interface description object](/arc-standards/arc-0004#interface-description). A user may read this object and instantiate a client that handles the encoding/decoding of the arguments and returns values using one of the SDKs or Algokit Utils.

A full example of a contract json file might look like:

```json
{
  "name": "super-awesome-contract",
  "networks": {
    "MainNet": {
      "appID": 123456
    }
