AlgoKit is a comprehensive software development kit designed to streamline and accelerate the process of building decentralized
applications on the Algorand blockchain. At its core, AlgoKit features a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool that provides
developers with an array of functionalities to simplify blockchain development. Along with the CLI, AlgoKit offers a suite of libraries,
templates, and tools that facilitate rapid prototyping and deployment of secure, scalable, and efficient applications. Whether you’re a
seasoned blockchain developer or new to the ecosystem, AlgoKit offers everything you need to harness the full potential of Algorand’s
impressive tech and innovative consensus algorithm.

## AlgoKit CLI

AlgoKit CLI is a powerful set of command line tools for Algorand developers. Its goal is to help developers build and launch secure, automated, production-ready applications rapidly.

## Algorand Python

If you are a Python developer, you no longer need to learn a complex smart contract language to write smart contracts.

Algorand Python is a semantically and syntactically compatible, typed Python language that works with standard Python tooling and allows you to write Algorand smart contracts (apps) and logic signatures in Python. Since the code runs on the Algorand virtual machine(AVM), there are limitations and minor differences in behaviors from standard Python, but all code you write with Algorand Python is Python code.

Here is an example of a simple Hello World smart contract written in Algorand Python:

<Code code={helloWorldPython} lang='py' frame='none' />

## Algorand TypeScript

If you are a TypeScript developer, you no longer need to learn a complex smart contract language to write smart contracts.

Algorand TypeScript is a semantically and syntactically compatible, typed TypeScript language that works with standard TypeScript tooling and allows you to write Algorand smart contracts (apps) and logic signatures in TypeScript. Since the code runs on the Algorand virtual machine(AVM), there are limitations and minor differences in behaviors from standard TypeScript, but all code you write with Algorand TypeScript is TypeScript code.

## AlgoKit Utils

AlgoKit Utils is a utility library recommended for you to use for all chain interactions like sending transactions, creating tokens(ASAs), calling smart contracts, and reading blockchain records. The goal of this library is to provide intuitive, productive utility functions that make it easier, quicker, and safer to build applications on Algorand. Largely, these functions wrap the underlying Algorand SDK but provide a higher-level interface with sensible defaults and capabilities for common tasks.

AlgoKit Utils is available in TypeScript and Python.

### Capabilities

## AlgoKit LocalNet

The AlgoKit LocalNet feature allows you to manage (start, stop, reset, manage) a locally sandboxed private Algorand network. This allows you to interact with and deploy changes against your own Algorand network without needing to worry about funding TestNet accounts, whether the information you submit is publicly visible, or whether you are connected to an active Internet connection (once the network has been started).

AlgoKit LocalNet uses Docker images optimized for a great developer experience. This means the Docker images are small and start fast. It also means that features suited to developers are enabled, such as KMD (so you can programmatically get faucet private keys).
