Application client that works with
[ARC-0032](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/blob/main/ARCs/arc-0032.md) application spec defined
smart contracts (e.g. via Beaker).

App client is a high productivity application client that works with ARC-0032 application spec defined smart
contracts, which you can use to create, update, delete, deploy, and call a smart contract and access state
data for it.

### Design

The design for the app client is based on a wrapper for parsing an
[ARC-0032](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/blob/main/ARCs/arc-0032.md) application spec and
wrapping the [App deployment](/build/algokit/utils/python/app-deploy) functionality and corresponding
[design](/build/algokit/utils/python/app-deploy#design).

## Creating an App Client

There are two key ways of instantiating an `ApplicationClient`:

- **Using App ID** - When needing to call an existing app by app ID or unconditionally create a new app. The
  function `ApplicationClient(algod_client, app_spec, app_id)` requires:

  - `algod_client`: An `AlgodClient` object
  - `app_spec`: An `ApplicationSpecification` object
  - `app_id`: The app_id of an existing application, or 0 if creating a new app

- **Using Creator and App Name** - When needing to deploy or find an app associated with a specific creator
  account and app name. The function `ApplicationClient(algod_client, app_spec, creator, indexer, app_lookup)`
  requires:
  - `algod_client`: An `AlgodClient`
  - `app_spec`: An `ApplicationSpecification`
  - `creator`: The address or `Account` of the creator of the app for which to search for the deployed app
    under
  - `indexer`:
  - `app_lookup`: Optional if an indexer is provided,
  - `app_name`: An overridden name to identify the contract with, otherwise `contract.name` is used from the
    app spec

Both approaches also allow specifying the following parameters that will be used as defaults for all
application calls: - `signer`: `TransactionSigner` to sign transactions with - `sender`: Address to use for
transaction signing, will be derived from the signer if not provided - `suggested_params`: Default
`SuggestedParams` to use; will use the current network suggested params by default

Both approaches also allow specifying a mapping of template values via the `template_values` parameter. This
will be used before compiling the application to replace any `TMPL_` variables that may be in the TEAL. The
`TMPL_UPDATABLE` and `TMPL_DELETABLE` variables used in some AlgoKit templates are handled by the `deploy`
method, but should be included if using `create` or `update` directly.

Example usage:

<Code code={createExample} lang='py' frame='none' mark={highlights} />

## Calling App Methods

There are various methods available on `ApplicationClient` that can be used to call an app:

- `call`: Used to call methods with an on complete action of `no_op`
- `create`: Used to create an instance of the app, by using an `app_id` of 0, includes the approval and clear
  programs in the call
- `update`: Used to update an existing app, includes the approval and clear programs in the call, and is
  called with an on complete action of `update_application`
- `delete`: Used to remove an existing app, is called with an on complete action of `delete_application`
- `opt_in`: Used to opt in to an existing app, is called with an on complete action of `opt_in`
- `close_out`: Used to close out of an existing app, is called with an on complete action of `opt_in`
- `clear_state`: Used to unconditionally close out from an app, calls the clear program of an app

Example usage:

<Code code={callAppMethodsExample} lang='py' frame='none' mark={highlights} />

### Specifying ABI Method to Call

All methods for calling an app that support ABI methods (everything except `clear_state`) take a parameter
`call_abi_method` which can be used to specify which method to call. The method selected can be specified
explicitly, or allow the client to infer the method where possible.

Supported values are:

- `None`: The default value, when `None` is passed the client will attempt to find any ABI method or bare
  method that is compatible with the provided arguments
- `False`: Indicates that an ABI method should not be used, and instead a bare method call is made
- `True`: Indicates that an ABI method should be used, and the client will attempt to find an ABI method that
  is compatible with the provided arguments
- `str`: If a string is provided, it will be interpreted as either an ABI signature specifying a method, or as
  an ABI method name
- `algosdk.abi.Method`: The specified ABI method will be called
- `ABIReturnSubroutine`: Any type that has a `method_spec` function that returns an `algosd.abi.Method`

Example usage:

<Code code={abiMethodsExample} lang='py' frame='none' mark={highlights} />

### ABI arguments

ABI arguments are passed as python keyword arguments e.g., to pass the ABI parameter `name` for the ABI method
`hello` the following syntax is used:

```python showLineNumbers=false
client.call("hello", name="world")
```

### Transaction Parameters

All methods for calling an app take an optional `transaction_parameters` argument, with the following
supported parameters:

- `signer`: The `TransactionSigner` to use on the call. This overrides any signer specified on the client
- `sender`: The address of the sender to use on the call, must be able to be signed for by the `signer`. This
  overrides any sender specified on the client
- `suggested_params`: `SuggestedParams` to use on the call. This overrides any suggested_params specified on
  the client
- `note`: Note to include in the transaction
- `lease`: Lease parameter for the transaction
- `boxes`: A sequence of boxes to use in the transaction, this is a list of (app_index, box_name) tuples
  `[(0, "box_name"), (0, ...)]`
- `accounts`: Account references to include in the transaction
- `foreign_apps`: Foreign apps to include in the transaction
- `foreign_assets`: Foreign assets to include in the transaction
- `on_complete`: The on complete action to use for the transaction, only available when using `call` or
  `create`
- `extra_pages`: Additional pages to allocate when calling `create`, by default a sufficient amount will be
  calculated based on the current approval and clear. This can be overridden, if more is required for a future
  update

Parameters can be passed as one of the dataclasses `CommonCallParameters`, `OnCompleteCallParameters`, or
`CreateCallParameters` (exact type depends on method used):

```python showLineNumbers=false
client.call("hello", transaction_parameters=algokit_utils.OnCompleteCallParameters(signer=...))
```

Alternatively, parameters can be passed as a dictionary e.g.

```python showLineNumbers=false
client.call("hello", transaction_parameters={"signer":...})
```

## Composing calls

If multiple calls need to be made in a single transaction, the `compose_` method variants can be used. All
these methods take an `AtomicTransactionComposer` as their first argument. Once all the calls have been added
to the [Atomic Transaction Composer (ATC)](/build/transactions/composer), it can then be executed.

Example usage:

<Code code={composingExample} lang='py' frame='none' mark='AtomicTransactionComposer' />

## Reading State

There are various methods defined that let you read state from the smart contract app:

- `get_global_state` - Gets the current global state of the app
- `get_local_state` - Gets the current local state for the given account address

## Handling Errors

Often when calling a smart contract during development you will get logic errors that cause an exception to
throw. This may be because of a failing assertion, a lack of fees, exhaustion of opcode budget, or any number
of other reasons.

When this occurs, you will generally get an error that looks something like the following:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
TransactionPool.Remember: transaction {TRANSACTION_ID}: logic eval error: {ERROR_MESSAGE}. Details: pc={PROGRAM_COUNTER_VALUE}, opcodes={LIST_OF_OP_CODES}
```

The information in that error message can be parsed and when combined with the
[source map from compilation](/build/algokit/utils/python/app-deploy#compilation-and-template-substitution)
you can expose debugging information that makes it much easier to understand what's happening.

When an error is thrown then the resulting error that is re-thrown will be a `LogicError`, which has the
following fields:

- `logic_error`: Original exception
- `program`: Program source (if available)
- `source_map`: Source map used (if available)
- `transaction_id`: Transaction ID of failing transaction
- `message`: The error message
- `line_no`: The line number in the TEAL program that
- `traces`: A list of Trace objects providing additional insights on simulation when debug mode is active

The function `trace()` will provide a formatted output of the surrounding TEAL where the error occurred.

<Aside>
    The extended information will only show if the Application Client has a source map. This will occur if:

    - The `ApplicationClient` instance has already called (`create`, `update`, or `deploy`)
    - `template_values` are provided when creating the `ApplicationClient`, so a SourceMap can be obtained automatically
    - `approval_source_map` on `ApplicationClient` has been set from a previously compiled approval program
    - A source map has been exported/imported using `export_source_map` / `import_source_map`

</Aside>

### Debug Mode and Traces Field

When debug mode is active, the `LogicError` will contain a field named `traces`. This field will include raw
simulate execution traces, providing a detailed account of the transaction simulation. These traces are
crucial for diagnosing complex issues and are automatically included in all application client calls when
debug mode is active.

<Aside type='caution' title='Enabling debug mode'>
Remember to enable debug mode (`config.debug = True`) to include raw simulate execution traces in the `LogicError`.
