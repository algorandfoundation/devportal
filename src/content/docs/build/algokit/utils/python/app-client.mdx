Application client that works with ARC-0032 application spec defined smart contracts (e.g. via Beaker).

App client is a high productivity application client that works with ARC-0032 application spec defined smart contracts, which you can use to create, update, delete, deploy and call a smart contract and access state data for it.

To see some usage examples check out the [automated tests](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-py/blob/main/tests/test_app_client_call.py).
