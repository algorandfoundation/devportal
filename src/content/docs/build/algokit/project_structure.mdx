Setting up a decentralized application project can be daunting, as it requires configuring components for development, 
testing, and deploying smart contracts to the blockchain. However, with AlgoKit, you can streamline this process and 
effortlessly set up a project with all the necessary components. In this guide, we'll explore what an AlgoKit project
is and how you can use it to kickstart your own Algorand project.

## What is an AlgoKit Project?
In the context of AlgoKit, a "project" refers to either a structured standalone or monorepo workspace that includes 
all the necessary components for developing, testing, and deploying Algorand applications. This may include smart 
contracts, front-end applications, and any associated configurations.

## 2 Types of AlgoKit Projects
AlgoKit supports two main types of project structures: Workspaces and Standalone Projects. This flexibility caters 
to the diverse needs of developers, whether managing multiple related projects or focusing on a single application.

- **Monorepo Workspace**: Ideal for complex applications comprising multiple sub-projects. Workspaces facilitate organized management of these sub-projects under a single root directory, streamlining dependency management and shared configurations.
- **Standalone Project**: Suited for simpler applications or when working on a single component. This structure offers straightforward project management, with each project residing in its own directory, independent of others.


## AlgoKit Monorepo Workspace
Workspaces are designed for managing multiple related projects under a single root directory. This approach is
beneficial for complex applications that consist of multiple sub-projects, such as a smart contract and a 
corresponding frontend application. Workspaces help in organizing these sub-projects in a structured manner, 
making it easier to manage dependencies and shared configurations.

Simply put, workspaces contain multiple AlgoKit standalone project folders within the `projects` folder and manage
them from a single root directory:
    
```bash
├── .algokit.toml # Configuration for AlgoKit projects in the workspace.
├── README.md # Quick start guide for the AlgoKit Workspace.
├── {your_workspace/project_name}.code-workspace
└── projects
        └── standalone project #1
        └── standalone project #2
```

### Creating an AlgoKit Monorepo Workspace
To create an AlgoKit monorepo workspace, run the following command:
```bash
algokit init
```
or 
```bash
algokit init –-workspace
```
:::note
`–-workspace` flag is enabled by default, so simply running `algokit init` will create an AlgoKit workspace.
:::

### Adding a Sub-Project to an AlgoKit Workspace
Once established, new projects can be added to the workspace, allowing for centralized management.

To add another sub-project within a workspace, run the following command at the root directory of the 
related AlgoKit workspace:
```bash
algokit init
```

:::note
Please note, that instantiating a workspace inside a workspace (aka 'workspace nesting') is not supported and not 
recommended. When you want to add a new project to an existing workspace make sure to run algokit init from the 
root of the workspace.
:::

### Marking a Project as a Workspace
To mark your project as workspace fill in the following in your `.algokit.toml` file:
```toml
[project]
type = 'workspace' # type specifying if the project is a workspace or standalone
projects_root_path = 'projects' # path to the root folder containing all sub-projects in the workspace
```

### VSCode optimizations
AlgoKit has a set of minor optimizations for VSCode users that are useful to be aware of:
- Templates created with the `--workspace` flag automatically include a VSCode code-workspace file. New projects 
added to an AlgoKit workspace are also integrated into an existing VSCode workspace.
- Using the `--ide` flag with init triggers automatic prompts to open the project and, if available, the code 
workspace in VSCode.

### Handling of the .github Folder
A key aspect of using the `--workspace` flag is how the .github folder is managed. This folder, which contains 
GitHub-specific configurations such as workflows and issue templates, is moved from the project directory to the 
root of the workspace. This move is necessary because GitHub does not recognize workflows located in subdirectories.

Here's a simplified overview of what happens:
1. If a .github folder is found in your project, its contents are transferred to the workspace's root .github folder.
2. Files with matching names in the destination are not overwritten; they're skipped.
3. The original .github folder is removed if it's left empty after the move.
4. A notification is displayed, advising you to review the moved .github contents to ensure everything is in order.

This process ensures that your GitHub configurations are properly recognized at the workspace level, allowing you 
to utilize GitHub Actions and other features seamlessly across your projects.

## Standalone Projects
Standalone projects are suitable for simpler applications or when working on a single component. This structure 
is straightforward, with each project residing in its own directory, independent of others. Standalone projects 
are ideal for developers who prefer simplicity or are focusing on a single aspect of their application and are 
sure that they will not need to add more sub-projects in the future.

### Creating a Standalone Project
To create a standalone project, use the `--no-workspace` flag during initialization. 
```bash
algokit init -–no-workspace
```

This instructs AlgoKit to bypass the workspace structure and set up the project as an isolated entity.

### Marking a Project as a Standalone Project
To mark your project as a standalone project fill in the following in your .algokit.toml file:
```toml
[project]
type = {'backend' | 'contract' | 'frontend'} # currently support 3 generic categories for standalone projects
name = 'my-project' # unique name for the project inside the workspace
```

:::note
We recommend using workspaces for most projects (hence enabled by default), as it provides a more organized 
and scalable approach to managing multiple sub-projects. However, standalone projects are a great choice for 
simple applications or when you are certain that you will not need to add more sub-projects in the future, 
for such cases simply append `--no-workspace` when using algokit init command. For more details on init command 
please refer to [init](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/features/init.md) command docs.
:::

Both workspaces and standalone projects are fully supported by AlgoKit's suite of tools, ensuring developers 
can choose the structure that best fits their workflow without compromising on functionality.

## AlgoKit CLI Project Commands
AlgoKit CLI also provides a collection of commands under algokit project that are useful for managing algokit 
projects.

- bootstrap - Bootstrap your project with AlgoKit.
- deploy - Deploy your smart contracts effortlessly to various networks.
- link - Powerful feature designed to streamline the integration between frontend and contract projects
- list - Enumerate all projects within an AlgoKit workspace.
- run - Define custom commands and manage their execution via algokit cli.
