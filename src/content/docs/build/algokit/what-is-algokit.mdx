AlgoKit is a collection of developer tools for developers building on the Algorand blockchain. It consists of a one-stop shop CLI tool that streamlines the zero-to-hero development journey, series templates to bootstrap your projects, Python support for smart contract development so that you donâ€™t have to learn a new language, an easy-to-use Utils library for all chain interactions, and more. 

## List of Developer Tools in AlgoKit 

Here is a list of developer tools within AlgoKit:

:::note
By using the AlgoKit CLI you will use all the below listed packages, so there is no need to install them separately.
:::

- AlgoKit CLI
- AlgoKit Utils
- Algorand Python
- Algorand TypeScript
- AlgoKit Localnet
- AVM Debugger
- Client Generator
- Testnet Dispenser



## AlgoKit CLI
AlgoKit CLI is the one-stop CLI tool for Algorand developers. Its goal is to help developers build and launch secure, automated, production-ready applications rapidly.

## AlgoKit Utils
AlgoKit Utils is a utility library recommended for you to use for all chain interactions like sending transactions, creating tokens(ASAs), calling smart contracts, and reading blockchain records. The goal of this library is to provide intuitive, productive utility functions that make it easier, quicker, and safer to build applications on Algorand. Largely, these functions wrap the underlying Algorand SDK but provide a higher-level interface with sensible defaults and capabilities for common tasks.

AlgoKit Utils is available in TypeScript and Python.


To learn more about AlgoKit Utils, refer to the following resources:

## Algorand Python
If you are a Python developer, you no longer need to learn a complex smart contract language to write smart contracts.

Algorand Python is a semantically and syntactically compatible, typed Python language that works with standard Python tooling and allows you to write Algorand smart contracts (apps) and smart signatures (logic signatures) in Python. Since the code runs on the Algorand virtual machine(AVM), there are limitations and minor differences in behaviors from standard Python, but all code you write with Algorand Python is Python code.  

To learn more about Algorand Python, refer to the following resources:
- Algorand Python section
- [Algorand Python Github repo](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/puya)
- [Algorand Python Documentation](https://algorandfoundation.github.io/puya/)

## Algorand TypeScript
If you are a TypeScript developer, you no longer need to learn a complex smart contract language to write smart contracts.

Algorand Python is a semantically and syntactically compatible, typed TypeScript language that works with standard TypeScript tooling and allows you to write Algorand smart contracts (apps) and smart signatures (logic signatures) in TypeScript. Since the code runs on the Algorand virtual machine(AVM), there are limitations and minor differences in behaviors from standard TypeScript, but all code you write with Algorand TypeScript is TypeScript code.  

To learn more about Algorand TypeScript, refer to the following resources:
- Algorand TypeScript section
- Algorand TypeScript Github repo
- Algorand TypeScript Documentation

## AlgoKit Localnet
The AlgoKit LocalNet feature allows you to manage (start, stop, reset, manage) a locally sandboxed private Algorand network. This allows you to interact with and deploy changes against your own Algorand network without needing to worry about funding TestNet accounts, whether the information you submit is publicly visible, or whether you are connected to an active Internet connection (once the network has been started).


AlgoKit LocalNet uses Docker images optimized for a great developer experience. This means the Docker images are small and start fast. It also means that features suited to developers are enabled, such as KMD (so you can programmatically get faucet private keys).


To learn more about AlgoKit Localnet, refer to the following resources:
- AlgoKit Localnet section
- [AlgoKit Localnet Github repository](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/features/localnet.md)

## AVM Debugger
The AlgoKit AVM VS Code debugger extension provides a convenient way to debug any Algorand Smart Contracts written in TEAL.

To learn more about the AVM debugger, refer to the following resources:
- AVM Debugger section
- [AVM Debugger Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AlgorandFoundation.algokit-avm-vscode-debugger)

## Client Generator
The client generator generates a type-safe smart contract client for the Algorand Blockchain that wraps the application client in AlgoKit Utils and tailors it to a specific smart contract. It does this by reading an ARC-0032 application spec file and generating a client that exposes methods for each ABI method in the target smart contract, along with helpers to create, update, and delete the application.

To learn more about the client generator, refer to the following resources:

## Testnet Dispenser
The AlgoKit TestNet Dispenser API provides functionalities to interact with the Dispenser service. This service enables users to fund and refund assets. 

To learn more about the testnet dispenser, refer to the following resources:
- Testnet Dispenser section
- [Testnet Dispenser Github Documentation](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit/blob/main/docs/testnet_api.md)

## More tools are coming soon!
More developer tools will be added to the AlgoKit Suite in the future. When they are released, they will be added to this page.
