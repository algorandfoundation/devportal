This is an example of the life cycle of a simple smart contract application that you can create, deploy, and
call with AlgoKit.

Application <-> Creator: Return Application ID of app
Caller -> Application: 'Call hello(str)str method with arg "world!"'
Application -> Caller: 'Return ABI string via log "Hello, world!"'
```
