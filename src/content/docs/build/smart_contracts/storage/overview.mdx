title: On-Chain Data Storage

Smart contract applications can store data in three different ways on the chain.

```d2
direction: left
Application Data Storage: {
  "Global State, 0-64x": {
    shape: sql_table
    key: 1-64 bytes
    value: uint64 or 0-127 bytes
  }
  "Per-Account Local State, 0-16x": {
    shape: sql_table
    key: 1-64 bytes
    value: uint64 or 0-127 bytes
  }
  Boxes, 0-âˆž: {
    shape: sql_table
    key: 1-64 bytes
    value: 0-32,768 bytes
  }
}
```

Although global state and box storage is associated only with an application, local state is associated with
both an application and a particular account.

```d2
Account Data Storage: {
  "Per-App Local State, 0-16x": {
    shape: sql_table
    key: 1-64 bytes
    value: uint64 or 0-127 bytes
  }
}
```

Any accout which has opted into smart contract applications may have data stored in local storage which is
associated with an application. The cost of this storage, which is assessed as an increase in the minimum
balance requirement on the account.
