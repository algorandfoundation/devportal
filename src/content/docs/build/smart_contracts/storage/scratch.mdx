A scratch space is a temporary storage area used to store values for later use in your program. It consists of 256 scratch slots.

The AVM (Algorand Virtual Machine) gives smart contracts access to this scratch space, allowing them to temporarily store values during execution. Other contracts in the same atomic group can also read this scratch space. Scratch space is only readable by transactions grouped with the current transaction, executing in the specified order. Contracts cannot read scratch space for transactions occurring after the current contract transaction.

## TEAL

In TEAL, you can use the `store`/`stores` and `load`/`loads` opcodes to read and write scratch slots. Additionally, you can use `gload`/`gloads` to read scratch slots from earlier transactions in the same group.

## Algorand Python

In Algorand Python, you can directly use these opcodes through the `op.Scratch` class. The accessed scratch slot indices or index ranges need to be declared using the `scratch_slots` variable during contract declaration.
