AlgoKit is a simple, one-stop tool for developers to quickly and easily build and launch secure, automated, production-ready decentralized applications on the Algorand protocol -- now also featuring native support for Python! This empowers developers to write Algorand apps in regular Python, one of the world's most popular programming languages.

In addition, AlgoKit features:

- A library of smart contract templates to kickstart your build
- All necessary application infrastructure running locally
- Toolchain integrations for languages you love, like Python and TypeScript
- A simplified frontend design experience

## Verify the Installation

To verify AlgoKit Installed correctly run the following.

```shell
algokit --version
```

Output similar to the following should be displayed:

```shell
algokit, version 2.5.2
```

## Start a LocalNet

AlgoKit supports running a [local version of the Algorand blockchain](/algokit/algokit-cli/localnet) on your computer. LocalNet is the perfect place to start as it is a private blockchain you can control to quickly and safely test your code.

To start an instance of this LocalNet first open **Docker Desktop** and then run the following command from the terminal:

```shell
algokit localnet start
```

This should start an instance of the LocalNet within docker. If you open the Docker Desktop application you should something similar to the following:

<Image src={localnet} alt='Docker Desktop LocalNet Instance' />

## Create an AlgoKit project

Now that AlgoKit is installed, you can rapidly create a new project to get started quickly. This can be done by running:

```shell
algokit init
```

This will launch a guided menu system to create a specific project tailored to your needs. You will first be prompted to select a specific template. The templates are basic starter applications for various Algorand development scenarios. To read more about templates checkout the [official AlgoKit Templates](FUTURELINK) page.

This guide will walk you through using either the **Python** or **TypeScript** smart contract starter template. Choose the language that you are most comfortable with.

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
    <TabItem label="Python" icon="seti:python">
    For this guide, we will use the Python smart contract starter template.

        <Steps>

            1. To create a new AlgoKit project you can easily do so by running:

                ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
                algokit init
                ```

                This will launch a guided menu system to create a specific project tailored to your needs. You will first
                be prompted to select the type of project you want to create. For this quick start guide, we will use the Python
                smart contract template, so select the **Smart Contracts** option.

                <Image src={algokitInit1} alt='AlgoKit Init #1' />

            2. Next, AlgoKit will ask you what programming language you want to use for the smart contract. With AlgoKit 2.0, you can now write
            Algorand smart contracts with native Python. Let's select **Python** as our smart contract language by pressing enter. <Image src={algokitInit2} alt="AlgoKit Init #2" />

            3. Then AlgoKit will ask you for the name of the project. Let's name it **hello-algorand**, but if you want to name it differently, feel free to do so!
            After writing the name, press enter to continue.<Image src={algokitInit3} alt="AlgoKit Init #3" />

            4. Next you can set the name of the smart contract. We will keep it as it is for now.<Image src={algokitInit4} alt="AlgoKit Init #4" />

            5. Next, you can select the template preset. The **Starter** preset is for quickly implementing and testing certain features
            whereas the **Production** preset is for production-ready applications. For this guide, let's select **Starter**.<Image src={algokitInit5} alt="AlgoKit Init #5" />

            6. Next, AlgoKit will ask you what language you want to use for contract deployment. After writing your smart contract
            you need to deploy and call the contract either from your frontend or backend. Since most frontend frameworks
            are in TypeScript, let's select TypeScript for this guide.<Image src={algokitInit6} alt="AlgoKit Init #6" />

            7. Next, AlgoKit will ask you if you want to run the `algokit project bootstrap` command to install the necessary dependencies.
            Say yes by pressing "y" This process can take a few minutes.<Image src={algokitInit7} alt="AlgoKit Init #7" />

            8. Finally, AlgoKit will ask you if you want to initialize a git repository. Let's say yes by pressing "y" so that we can easily
            push our AlgoKit project to Github.<Image src={algokitInit8} alt="AlgoKit Init #8" />

            9. Once finished, VS Code should automatically be opened with the initialized project if VS Code is set as your default editor. If not, `cd` into the project directory and open the project in your IDE of choice.

            10. This starter app contains one smart contract written in [Algorand Python](https://algorandfoundation.github.io/puya/) named `HelloWorld` in the `smart_contracts/hello_world/contract.py` file. The contract has a method called `hello` that takes in a `String` and returns a `String`. <Image src={algokit_v2_starter} alt='AlgoKit Starter Contract' />
        </Steps>

    ## Run the Demo Application

    Once the starter project is created, you will notice in the `smart_contracts/hello_world` folder a file named `deploy_config.py` which is a simple example of using AlgoKit to deploy and make a call to the `contract.py` smart contract on the LocalNet instance started earlier.

    <Image src={algokit_v2_demo} alt='AlgoKit Starter config' />

    To deploy the `HelloWorld` smart contract and then call it passing the parameter `name` assigned to `world`, press **F5** and it will:

    1. Start LocalNet
    2. Build the smart contract
    3. Deploy and call the smart contract (`contract.py`)

    If you would like to manually build and deploy the `HelloWorld` smart contract run the following AlgoKit commands:

    ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none title="Build and Deploy"
    algokit project run build
    algokit project deploy
    ```

    This should produce something similar to the following in the VSCode terminal.

    ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
    HelloWorld not found in PDEEWXLITMAPDMDYGP4XUV2EUJVPNZVKR7OUSSFZ63U4XNL2Y25FN5PYN4 account, deploying app.
    HelloWorld (v1.0) deployed successfully, with app id 1002.
    Called hello on HelloWorld (1002) with name=world, received: Hello, world
    ```

    The App ID of of the deployed contract and its Algorand address is displayed, followed by the message returned from the smart contract call (`Hello, world`).

    At this point you have deployed a simple contract to an Algorand network and called it successfully!

    Additionally, you can find the native TEAL smart contract code, contract ABI, and the auto generated typed application client in the `artifacts` folder.
    <Image src={algokit_v2_json} alt='AlgoKit Starter Demo' />

    These files can be used by tools like [Lora](https://lora.algokit.io/localnet) and [goal](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/clis/goal/goal/) to deploy your smart contract to the various Algorand networks.

## Using Lora

Lora is a web-based user interface that let's you visualize accounts, transactions, assets and applications on an Algorand network and also provides ability to deploy and call smart contracts. This works for TestNet, MainNet and also LocalNet. While AlgoKit surfaces both a programming interface and a command line interface for interacting with Algorand, it also allows you to quickly open Lora so you can see what's happening visually.

Lora can be launched from AlgoKit by running the following command from the terminal.

```shell
algokit explore
```

By default it will open Lora and point to LocalNet (It will be displayed as `LocalNet` in the upper right hand corner), but you can pass in parameters to point it to TestNet and MainNet too.

This command will launch your default web browser and load the Lora web application.

:::note
If you are using Safari, then it won't work against LocalNet and you will need to open it in a different browser.

### Create / Connect local account for testing

To issue commands against the LocalNet network you need an account with ALGO in it. Lora gives you three options for connecting to a local wallet: `Connect KMD`, `Connect MNEMONIC`, and `Connect Lute`

- `Connect KMD`: Lora will automatically import KMD wallet.

- `Connect MNEMONIC`: You can manually input a MNEMONIC for an account you own.

- `Connect Lute`: You can create local accounts from [Lute](https://lute.app/) and connect to them.

In this guide, we will use the KMD wallet.

Select `Connect wallet` located at top right hand side of the webpage and you will be prompted with the three wallet choices. Choose the `Connect KMD` option. This will prompt you to enter the KMD password. If this is your first time building on Algorand, you do not have a KMD password so leave it blank and click `OK`. This will connect the KMD account to Lora so you can use that account for signing transactions from the Lora user interface.

### Deploy the Hello World application

<Steps>
    1. To deploy your smart contract application, select the `App Lab` menu and click on the `Create` button. <Image src={lora2} alt='Lora 2' />

    2. Click `Deploy new` and `Select an ARC-32 JSON app spec file` to browse to the artifacts created in the previous section of this guide. Select the `HelloWorld.arc32.json` manifest file.

        <Image src={lora3} alt='Lora 3' />
        <Image src={lora4} alt='Lora 4' />
        <Image src={lora5} alt='Lora 5' />

    3. This will load the specific manifest file for the Hello World sample application. Click `Next`.

        <Image src={lora6} alt='Lora 6' />

    4. You can change the `Name` and the `Version` of your app. We will keep it as it is. Click `Next`.

        <Image src={lora7} alt='Lora 7' />

    5. Click the `() Call` button. Then build and add the create transaction by clicking `Add`.

        <Image src={lora8} alt='Lora 8' />
        <Image src={lora9} alt='Lora 9' />

    6. Click `Deploy` and sign the transaction by clicking `OK` in the KMD pop up to deploy the smart contract to the local Algorand network.

        <Image src={lora10} alt='Lora 10' />

    7. You should now see the deployed `HelloWorld` contract on the `App Lab` page.

        <Image src={lora11} alt='Lora 11' />

    8. Now click on the `App ID` inside of the `HelloWorld` card to go to the `Application` page.

        <Image src={lora12} alt='Lora 12' />

    9. Inside the `ABI Methods` section, you should see the `hello` method. Click on the drop down and the `Call` button. You will be prompted with a popup allowing you to enter the parameter for the `hello` method and call it.

        <Image src={lora13} alt='Lora 13' />

    10. Enter a string in the `value` input and click on `Add`.

        <Image src={lora14} alt='Lora 14' />

    11. You should now see the transaction you just built on the `Application` page. Click `Send` and sign the transaction with your KMD wallet to execute the transaction.

        <Image src={lora15} alt='Lora 15' />

    12. You should now see the `Send Result` showing you the details about the transaction you just executed!

        <Image src={lora16} alt='Lora 16' />

    13. You can also click on `Transaction ID` to go to the `Transaction` page and see the full detail of the transaction.
        <Image src={lora17} alt='Lora 17' />
</Steps>

You have now successfully deployed and executed a smart contract method call using Lora!
