title: Overview

The Additional Resources section curates a variety of ancillary and third-party resources that may be relevant to Algorand development. These resources are not created, maintained, or officially endorsed by Algorand Foundation, but they are included here because we are aware of them and believe Algorand developers may find them useful.

## Algorand Foundation GitHub Repositories

The Algorand Foundation organization on GitHub houses all of the code repositories created and maintained by the Foundation. While this developer portal is intended to provide developers with the necessary materials to learn and succeed in using Algorand technologies, sometimes it may be helpful to directly explore our repos. The codebases often contain additional examples, unit and/or integration tests that exercise the code, and additional context.

View all Algorand Foundation repositories on GitHub [here](https://github.com/orgs/algorandfoundation/repositories).

## Contributing

If you know of a high-quality educational resource or open source code repositories not included here that would highly relevant to Algorand Developers, you may submit them using the GitHub issue template [here](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/devportal/issues/new/choose). Advertisements for products or services will not be accepted. Submissions will be reviewed strictly for appropriateness to include in a technical documentation site.
