This guide details how to configure Peer-to-peer (P2P) networking when using the [FUNC node controller](https://github.com/GalaxyPay/func).

## Configuring P2P on your node

There are three different P2P configuration modes:

### P2P Mode: OFF (Default)

P2P networking is disabled and your node will only connect to Permissioned Repeaters.

#### Why choose this mode?

Choose this mode if you have strict bandwidth constraints.

#### How to configure

Assuming FUNC is already [installed](https://github.com/GalaxyPay/func?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), open the FUNC [app](http://localhost:3536/), click Manage->Configure, and ensure both checkboxes are toggled off:

### P2P Mode: HYBRID (Recommended)

P2P networking is enabled and your node will connect to _both_ Permissionless Repeaters and Permissioned Repeaters.

#### Why choose this mode?

Choose this mode if you have flexible bandwidth constraints. This mode will also result in the greatest resiliency by connecting to both P2P and non-P2P networks.

#### How to configure

Assuming FUNC is already [installed](https://github.com/GalaxyPay/func?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), open the FUNC [app](http://localhost:3536/), click Manage->Configure, and ensure the "Enable P2P Hybrid Mode" checkbox is toggled on:

### P2P Mode: ON

P2P networking is enabled and your node will connect to only Permissionless Repeaters and validators.

#### Why choose this mode?

Choose this mode if you have very high bandwidth constraints and are able to closely monitor your usage.

#### How to configure

Assuming FUNC is already [installed](https://github.com/GalaxyPay/func?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), open the FUNC [app](http://localhost:3536/), click Manage->Configure, and ensure the "Enable P2P Mode" checkbox is toggled on:
