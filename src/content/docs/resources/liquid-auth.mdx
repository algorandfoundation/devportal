## Overview

LiquidAuth is a decentralized, self-hosted authentication service built by the Algorand Foundation.  
It gives users full control over their data and privacy by removing intermediaries between wallets and applications.

By combining **FIDO2/WebAuthn** with **WebRTC**, LiquidAuth enables passwordless authentication, links **passkeys** to crypto **keypairs**, and establishes direct, encrypted **peer-to-peer sessions** — all without relying on centralized identity providers.

## Why It Matters

Most authentication systems today depend on centralized providers. These platforms store and control user credentials, introducing single points of failure — if a provider goes offline, changes policies, or is compromised, users may lose access to their accounts or data.

LiquidAuth removes this dependency by enabling **peer-to-peer authentication** through cryptographic **passkeys** that can be linked to **keypairs** commonly used in wallets and other crypto systems.

Users retain complete control over their credentials, while developers can integrate secure access without managing passwords or relying on external identity services.  
This opens the possibility of creating and interacting with **passwordless systems** that are both secure and user-friendly.

It simplifies authentication, enhances privacy, and gives both users and developers greater control — without adding complexity or external dependencies.

## Use Cases

LiquidAuth enables decentralized and secure authentication flows between dApps and wallets.

In a typical setup, the **dApp provides the LiquidAuth Service**, while **wallets act as clients**.  
The wallet receives the `Origin` and `RequestId` from the dApp and uses them to authenticate with the service provided as the `Origin`.

This structure allows developers to design authentication that is both **trustless** and **privacy-preserving**, removing the need for centralized intermediaries.

### Example use cases include

- **Passwordless wallet login:** Users can sign in to dApps through their wallets using passkeys instead of traditional credentials.
- **Decentralized identity verification:** Wallets can prove ownership of a keypair to a dApp without revealing personal data.
- **Future extensions:** Expand the same protocol to handle transaction signing and cross-dApp interactions.

**Pera Wallet** is the first adopter of LiquidAuth, introducing **decentralized passkey authentication** for **passwordless Web3 access**.

## How to Use It

To use LiquidAuth, a **dApp** must host the **LiquidAuth Service**, while connected **wallets** act as clients.  
When a user initiates authentication, the dApp sends an `Origin` and `RequestId` to the wallet.  
The wallet then uses its **passkey**, linked to a crypto **keypair**, to sign and verify the request through the LiquidAuth Service.

Wallets should implement the **Offer** `SignalClient` and `WebAuthn Extension` to establish a peer-to-peer connection with the dApp.  
dApps should implement the **Answer** `SignalClient` and host the Service.

This process establishes a **secure, peer-to-peer session** between the wallet and the dApp.

## Quick Start Guide

Starting with LiquidAuth is simple.  
You’ll need to set up a **LiquidAuth Server** and connect a **Browser Client**.  
The server handles **passkey registration** and **verification**, while the client manages **authentication requests** and **peer-to-peer communication** between dApps and wallets.
