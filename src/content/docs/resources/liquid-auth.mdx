## Overview

LiquidAuth is **the open standard for passwordless Web3 login** — a decentralized, self-hosted authentication service built by the Algorand Foundation.

It bridges Web2 and Web3 authentication by combining **FIDO2 passkeys**, **WebAuthn**, and **decentralized identity**, giving users complete control over their credentials and privacy.

By leveraging **FIDO2/WebAuthn** and **WebRTC**, LiquidAuth provides secure, peer-to-peer authentication that links **passkeys** to crypto **keypairs**, eliminating centralized intermediaries.

---

## Why It Matters

Most authentication systems today rely on centralized providers. These platforms store and control user credentials, introducing single points of failure — if a provider goes offline, changes policies, or is compromised, users may lose access to their accounts or data.

LiquidAuth removes this dependency by enabling **decentralized authentication** powered by **WebAuthn** and **FIDO2 passkeys** that can be linked to **keypairs** commonly used in wallets and other crypto systems.

Users retain complete control and **self-custody** over their credentials, while developers can integrate **secure, passwordless access** without managing passwords or relying on external identity providers.

This opens the possibility of creating and interacting with **passwordless Web3 systems** that are both secure and user-friendly.

It simplifies authentication, enhances privacy, and gives both users and developers greater control — advancing **passwordless Web3 identity** without adding complexity or external dependencies.

---

## Use Cases

LiquidAuth enables **secure authentication flows** between **dApps** and **wallets**.

In a typical setup, the **dApp provides the LiquidAuth Service**, while **wallets act as clients** authenticating with the corresponding service.

This structure allows developers to build authentication that is both **trustless** and **privacy-preserving**, removing the need for intermediaries.

### Example use cases include

- **Wallet-based login:** Users can sign in to dApps through their wallets using passkeys instead of traditional credentials.
- **Identity verification:** Wallets can prove ownership of a keypair to a dApp without exposing personal data.
- **Future extensions:** The same protocol can be extended to handle transaction signing and cross-dApp interactions.

**Pera Wallet** is the first adopter of LiquidAuth, introducing **passkey-based authentication** for **secure Web3 access**.

---

## How to Use It

To integrate LiquidAuth, a **dApp** must host the **LiquidAuth Service**, while **wallets** act as clients.  
When a user initiates authentication, the dApp sends an `Origin` and `RequestId` to the wallet, which uses its **passkey** linked to a **keypair** to sign and verify the request through the service.

Wallets should implement the **Offer** `SignalClient` and `WebAuthn Extension`, while dApps implement the **Answer** `SignalClient` and host the service.

This process creates a **secure session** between the wallet and the dApp.

## Quick Start Guide

Getting started with LiquidAuth is straightforward.  
Set up a **LiquidAuth Server** and connect a **Browser Client** — the server manages **passkey registration** and **verification**, while the client handles **authentication requests** and communication between **dApps** and **wallets**.
