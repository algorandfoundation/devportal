## What is a node

A node is a computer, running the algorand software (algod), that participates in the Algorand
network playing a crucial role in maintaining the blockchain, by processing blocks, participating in
the consensus protocol or storing data.

There are two primary types of nodes in Algorand:

- Relay Nodes: Primarily facilitate communication by routing data to connected non-relay nodes. They
  interact with other relay nodes and distribute blocks to all linked non-relay nodes.

- Non-Relay Nodes: Connect exclusively to relay nodes and can participate in consensus. While
  non-relay nodes may establish connections with multiple relay nodes, they do not connect directly
  to other non-relay nodes.

Also, depending on configuration, the nodes can be categorized as following:

- Archival Nodes: Store the entire blockchain ledger.
- Non-Archival Nodes: Retain only the last 1000 blocks.
- Participation Nodes: Actively engage in consensus by proposing and voting on blocks.

More information about node types can be found [here](/nodes/types).

## Consensus and Participation

Algorand uses a unique consensus protocol called Pure Proof of Stake (PPoS) to achieve agreement on
the blockchain, using a VRF (Verifiable Random Function) to randomly select leaders to propose
blocks and committee members to vote on block proposals. This process is weighted based on the stake
each account holds

Algorand’s Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus relies on participation from online accounts. Nodes
with valid participation keys can propose and vote on blocks- Managing participation keys and
online/offline statuses is critical for ensuring network health and avoiding negative impacts on
consensus thresholds.

[This section](/protocol/overview) provides detailed information about consensus and participation

## Running a Node

You can run an Algorand node (the algod software) using any of the following methods:

- [NodeKit](/nodes/nodekit-reference/commands/nodekit) – A streamlined CLI tool that simplifies
  deploying and managing Algorand nodes. It offers pre-configured environments, making it ideal for
  developers and operators looking to quickly set up nodes for various use cases.
- Package Manager (Debian, Fedora and CentOS) – Install via official repositories, enabling standard
  system service management.
- Updater Script (Linux & macOS) – Required on macOS and supported on all Linux distributions,
  allowing a customizable data directory but relying on a manual update process.

Docker in [this section](/nodes/management/best-practices).

## Node Management

Node management involves preparing your environment to run a stable, high-performance Algorand node
and following best practices that keep the network healthy and ensure reliability and performance.
At a minimum, you need a computer that meets the published requirements, robust power backup, and a
reliable internet connection (possibly with redundancy); and following best practices (e.g., not
running multiple nodes on the same machine, overloading a node with too many participation keys, or
under-provisioning RAM and CPU).

Proper node management also covers protocol updates, secure operating procedures, and, when needed,
switching between networks.

Best practices and extra details can be found in the
[node management guide](/nodes/management/best-practices).
