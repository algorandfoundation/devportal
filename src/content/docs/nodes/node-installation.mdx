title: Node Installation Guide
---

This guide shows how to install and run an Algorand node on your system. It covers installation methods for both Linux distributions and MacOS, with Linux users having the option of package manager or updater script installation.

## Installation Methods

### 1. Package Manager Installation

_Supported on Debian-based (Ubuntu, Linux Mint) and Red Hat-based (Fedora, CentOS) distributions._

Recommended for users on supported Linux distributions. This method provides automated updates, a fixed directory structure, and a pre-configured system service, simplifying maintenance.

### 2. Updater Script Installation

_Supported on Linux distributions and MacOS._

Required for MacOS users and supported for all Linux distributions. This method allows customizable data directory location. However, it uses a manual update process. It works with MacOS and all Linux distributions, including openSUSE Leap, Manjaro, Mageia, Alpine, and Solus.

> **Warning**: Choose one installation method and stick with it. Mixing methods can lead to complex troubleshooting issues. If the package manager method is available for your Linux system, it is strongly recommended over the updater script method.

## Alternative Options

### Docker

Official Docker images are available from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/algorand/algod).

### Windows

You can build native binaries using Rand Labs’ [repository](https://github.com/randlabs/algorand-windows-node) and [accompanying tutorial](https://developer.algorand.org/tutorials/compile-and-run-the-algorand-node-natively-windows/).

### Development

If you need a private network for development, consider using [AlgoKit](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/algokit/) for a simpler setup. Even without running a node, installing Algorand software provides access to essential developer tools such as `msgpacktool` and `algokey`, along with other development utilities.

## Hardware Requirements

_Last updated: April 3, 2024_

### Participation Nodes

Participation nodes are actively involved in the Algorand consensus protocol by proposing and voting on blocks. They require higher network bandwidth to communicate with other nodes efficiently.

- 8 vCPU
- 16 GB RAM
- 100 GB NVMe SSD or equivalent
- 1 Gbps connection with low latency (< 100ms)

### Non-Participation Nodes

Non-participation nodes maintain a current copy of the blockchain but do not participate in consensus. They are useful for API endpoints and development environments.

- 8 vCPU
- 16 GB RAM
- 100 GB NVMe SSD or equivalent
- 100Mbps connection with low latency (< 100ms)

### Archival Nodes

Archival nodes store the entire history of the blockchain from genesis, making them valuable for applications requiring historical data access. They need significantly more storage than other node types.

- 8 vCPU
- 16 GB RAM
- Storage:
  - 3 TB SSD for blocks and catchpoints ([ColdDataDir](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/reference/config/#algod-configuration-settings))
  - 100 GB NVMe SSD for accounts ([HotDataDir](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/reference/config/#algod-configuration-settings))
- 5 TB/month egress
- 1 Gbps connection with low latency (< 100ms)

> **Info**: While directly-attached NVMe SSDs are recommended, AWS EBS gp3 volumes have proven sufficient as of October 2022. Monitor performance closely and be prepared to upgrade if TPS increases significantly.

## Package Manager Installation

The package manager installs Algorand node software in the standard system locations:

- Binary files: `/usr/bin`
- Data directory: `/var/lib/algorand`
- KMD files: `${HOME}/.algorand/kmd-version`

See [Node Artifacts](/nodes/reference/artifacts) for a complete list of installed files.

> **Info**: The Key Manager Daemon (KMD) is Algorand's wallet process that manages keys and signing operations. It is used for wallet operations through the SDKs and REST API.

It is recommended to configure the environment by adding to your shell config file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
export ALGORAND_DATA=/var/lib/algorand
```

This sets a permanent environment variable that tells Algorand tools where to find your node's data directory, eliminating the need to specify it with the `-d` flag in every command.

### Installation

#### For Debian-Based Systems (Ubuntu, Linux Mint)

1. First, update your system and install required packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y gnupg2 curl software-properties-common
```

2. Add Algorand’s repository and security key:

```bash
curl -o - https://releases.algorand.com/key.pub | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/algorand.asc
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://releases.algorand.com/deb/ stable main"
sudo apt-get update
```

3. Install Algorand (choose one option):

```bash
# Option A: Install Algorand with developer tools
sudo apt-get install -y algorand-devtools

# Option B: Install only Algorand node
sudo apt-get install -y algorand
```

#### For Red Hat-Based Systems (Fedora, CentOS)

##### CentOS 7

1. Import Algorand’s repository key and set up the repository:

```bash
curl -O https://releases.algorand.com/rpm/rpm_algorand.pub
sudo rpmkeys --import rpm_algorand.pub
sudo yum install yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://releases.algorand.com/rpm/stable/algorand.repo
```

2. Install Algorand (choose one option):

```bash
# Option A: Install Algorand with developer tools
sudo yum install algorand-devtools

# Option B: Install only Algorand node
sudo yum install algorand
```

##### Fedora or CentOS 8 Stream

1. Import Algorand’s repository key and set up the repository:

```bash
curl -O https://releases.algorand.com/rpm/rpm_algorand.pub
sudo rpmkeys --import rpm_algorand.pub
dnf install -y 'dnf-command(config-manager)'
dnf config-manager --add-repo=https://releases.algorand.com/rpm/stable/algorand.repo
```

2. Install Algorand:

```bash
dnf install algorand
```

### Post-Installation Notes

After installation, Algorand is configured as a system service and starts automatically on MainNet. See [switching networks](/nodes/management/switch-network) for details on changing to another network.

All core binaries are installed in `/usr/bin`, so you can run `algod` and `goal` commands from any directory. Your node's data will be stored in `/var/lib/algorand`.

Since the data directory `/var/lib/algorand` is owned by the user `algorand` and the daemon `algod` is run as the user `algorand`, operations related to wallets and accounts (`goal account ...` and `goal wallet ...`) need to be run as the user `algorand`. For example, to list participation keys, use:

```bash
# If $ALGORAND_DATA is set:
sudo -u algorand -E goal account listpartkeys

# If $ALGORAND_DATA is not set:
sudo -u algorand -E goal account listpartkeys -d /var/lib/algorand
```

> **Warning**: Never run `goal` as root (using `sudo` directly). This can compromise file permissions in `/var/lib/algorand`.

Additional tools are available through separate packages:

- Developer utilities through the `algorand-devtools` package
- Extra tools like `pingpong` in the `tools_stable_linux-amd64_2.1.6.tar.gz` package

### Installing the Developer Tools

The `algorand-devtools` package (introduced in version 2.1.5) provides additional developer utilities:

- `carpenter`
- `catchupsrv`
- `msgpacktool`
- `tealcut`
- `tealdbg`

Installation is straightforward using your system's package manager (`apt` or `yum`). The package manager will handle dependencies automatically:

- If Algorand is not installed, it will be installed automatically
- If Algorand is already installed, it will be updated if needed

See the [installation instructions](/nodes/node-installation#for-debian-based-systems-ubuntu-linux-mint) above for detailed installation commands.

### Managing Your Node

The node starts automatically after package manager installation. To control the node manually, use the following commands:

To start your node:

```bash
sudo systemctl start algorand
```

To stop your node:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop algorand
```

To check your node's status:

```bash
goal node status -d /var/lib/algorand
```

## Updater Script Installation

The updater script installation requires two main directories:

- Binary directory (recommended: `~/node`) - Contains Algorand executables
- Data directory (recommended: `~/node/data`) - Stores blockchain and node data

When updating, the script archives your existing installation before overwriting the binaries. Configure your environment by adding to your shell config file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
export ALGORAND_DATA="$HOME/node/data"
export PATH="$HOME/node:$PATH"
```

These settings tell Algorand tools where to find your data directory and make `goal` commands directly executable.

### MacOS Installation

Verified on OSX v12.3.1 (Monterey).

1. Create and enter the installation directory:

```bash
mkdir ~/node
cd ~/node
```

2. Download and prepare the updater script:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/algorand/go-algorand/rel/stable/cmd/updater/update.sh -O
chmod 744 update.sh
```

3. Run the installer:

```bash
./update.sh -i -c stable -p ~/node -d ~/node/data -n
```

> **Note**: For beta releases, use `-c beta` instead of `-c stable`.

The installer will download and install the latest package from S3. The `-n` flag prevents automatic node startup. All binaries, including developer tools, are included in this installation.

4. Configure your environment by adding to your shell config file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
export ALGORAND_DATA="$HOME/node/data"
export PATH="$HOME/node:$PATH"
```

These environment variables help you run `goal` commands without specifying the data directory each time.

### Linux Installation

Verified on Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, openSUSE Leap, Manjaro, Mageia, Alpine, and Solus. Other modern Linux distributions should work as well.

1. Create and enter the installation directory:

```bash
mkdir ~/node
cd ~/node
```

2. Download and prepare the updater script:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/algorand/go-algorand/rel/stable/cmd/updater/update.sh
chmod 744 update.sh
```

3. Run the installer:

```bash
./update.sh -i -c stable -p ~/node -d ~/node/data -n
```

The installer will download and install the latest package from S3. The `-n` flag prevents automatic node startup. All binaries, including developer tools, are included in this installation.

4. Configure your environment by adding to your shell config file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
export ALGORAND_DATA="$HOME/node/data"
export PATH="$HOME/node:$PATH"
```

These environment variables help you run `goal` commands without specifying the data directory each time.

### Post-Installation Notes

After installation, your node must be started manually. Your data will be stored in the directory you specified during installation (recommended: `~/node/data`).

Unlike package manager installations where binaries are in `/usr/bin`, your binaries will be in your specified installation directory (recommended: `~/node`). Make sure you've set up your environment variables as instructed above to run commands from any directory.

The installation includes all binaries, including developer tools - there is no separate devtools package. This differs from package manager installations which separate these packages.

### Managing Your Node

Unlike package manager installations, nodes installed via the updater script must be started manually. To control the node manually, use the following commands:

To start your node:

```bash
goal node start
```

To stop your node:

```bash
goal node stop
```

To verify your node is running:

```bash
pgrep algod
```

### Setting Up systemd Service

When installing using the updater script, several shell scripts are bundled in the tarball to help with running `algod`. One of these is the `systemd-setup.sh` script to create a system service.

Usage: `./systemd-setup.sh username group [bindir]`

#### Installation

1. Create the service with root privileges:

```bash
sudo ./systemd-setup.sh algorand algorand
```

This creates `/lib/systemd/system/algorand@.service` using the included template (`algorand@.service.template`). The template file includes helpful information at its top and is worth reviewing.

2. Specify binary location (optional):

```ini
[Service]
ExecStart=@@BINDIR@@/algod -d %I
User=@@USER@@
Group=@@GROUP@@
```

The service template above shows how `systemd` locates your `algod` binary. By default, it uses the current working directory, but you can specify a different location using the `bindir` parameter, which must be an absolute path:

```bash
sudo ./systemd-setup.sh algorand algorand /path/to/binary/directory
```

3. Register the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

This command makes `systemd` aware that the service is present on the system. You should also run this command if you make any changes to the service after installation.

4. Start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start algorand@$(systemd-escape $ALGORAND_DATA)
```

This command starts the Algorand service using your data directory path (specified by `$ALGORAND_DATA`). The `systemd-escape` command formats the path to be compatible with systemd.

To configure the service to start automatically when your system boots:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable algorand@$(systemd-escape $ALGORAND_DATA)
```
