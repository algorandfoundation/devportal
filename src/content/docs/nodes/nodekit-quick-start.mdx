Get up and running with NodeKit in minutes. This guide will walk you through installing NodeKit and setting up your first Algorand node, including generating participation keys for an account and registering them online.

NodeKit can help you with:

- Installing and configuring an Algorand node
- Syncing your node with the latest state of the network
- Managing consensus participation keys
- Monitoring your node and the network

## Installing NodeKit

To get started with NodeKit, copy-paste this command in your terminal:

<Tabs syncKey="os">
<TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">

```bash showLineNumbers=false
wget -qO- https://nodekit.run/install.sh | bash
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="macOS" icon="apple">

```sh showLineNumbers=false
curl -fsSL https://nodekit.run/install.sh | bash
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<details>

<summary>Troubleshooting: Command 'bash' not found</summary>

Some versions of Mac OS may not include the required `bash` executable that runs the installer.

If you get an error about `bash` not being available, please install bash on your system manually.

For Mac OS, a popular way to do this is to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and then install bash using:

```bash showLineNumbers=false
brew install bash
```

</details>

This will detect your operating system and download the appropriate NodeKit executable to your local directory.

It will then immediately start the bootstrap process to get your Algorand node up and running:

## Bootstrapping the Algorand Node

import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

### How to Start the Process

The bootstrap process is automatically started after following the installation instructions above, but it can also be triggered manually by running this command:

```bash showLineNumbers=false
./nodekit bootstrap
```

### Prompts: Installation and Fast-Catchup

`nodekit bootstrap` will check to see if there is a node already installed.

If there is none, it will ask if you want to start a node installation:

<Code showLineNumbers={false} wrap="no" code="Installing A Node

It looks like you're running this for the first time. Would you like to install a node? (y/n)" />

---

It will then ask if you want to perform a "fast-catchup" with the network:

<Code showLineNumbers={false} wrap="no" code="Regular sync with the network usually takes multiple days to weeks. You can optionally perform fast-catchup to sync in 30-60 minutes instead.

Would you like to preform a fast-catchup after installation? (y/n)" />

Fast-catchup saves a lot of time, so we recommend responding Yes.

---

Assuming you have responded "Yes" to the node install prompt, you will now be prompted for your user password:

```bash showLineNumbers=false
WARN (You may be prompted for your password)
INFO Installing Algod on Linux
INFO Installing with apt-get
[sudo] password for user:
```

<details>
  <summary>Why is the installer asking for my password?</summary>
  The installer will ask for your user password during the node installation process.

This is required by your operating system in order to install new software.

</details>

### Installation

After you enter your password, you can now sit back and wait until your Algorand node is installed and syncs with the network.

The installation phase should only take a few minutes. Your terminal will look like this during the installation phase:

![Screenshot of first phase of "nodekit bootstrap" process](/src/assets/images/nodekit-bootstrap.png)

### Fast Catchup

After installation is complete, NodeKit will automatically start the NodeKit user interface.

This will display the progress of catching up to the latest state of the Algorand network:

![Screenshot of second phase of "nodekit bootstrap" process - fast catchup](/src/assets/images/nodekit-fast-catchup.png)

This process usually takes between 30-60 minutes, depending on your hardware and network connection.

When the process is done, the Fast Catchup status information will disappear and the yellow `FAST-CATCHUP` status at the top will change to a green `RUNNING` state.

![NodeKit running in fast-catchup state](/src/assets/images/nodekit-state-running.png)

<details>
  <summary>Troubleshooting: Fast-catchup</summary>
  If the fast catchup process does not complete within 1-2 hours, check the following:

### Your Hardware Meets the Requirements

Check that your node meets the [hardware requirements](/nodes/installation/manual-installation#hardware-requirements) for a participation node.

#### Nodekit is in FAST-CATCHUP state

The colored status at the top of Nodekit should be in a yellow `FAST-CATCHUP` state:

![NodeKit fast-catchup status indicator](/src/assets/images/nodekit-state-fast-catchup.png)

If not, exit nodekit with `Q` and run `./nodekit catchup` to start catching up. Then run `./nodekit` again to enter the user interface.

After fast-catchup completes successfully, it is normal for a node to be in a `SYNCING` state for a few minutes:

![NodeKit syncing status indicator](/src/assets/images/nodekit-state-syncing.png)

During this the `Latest Round` number should be increasing rapidly.

If there is no progress for a while, or the Latest Round value is smaller than `46000000` (46 million) then you should start fast-catchup again.

</details>

## Generating Participation Keys

If it is not running already, start NodeKit with this command:

```bash showLineNumbers=false
./nodekit
```

After your node has fully synced with the network, you will see a green `RUNNING` label at the top:

![NodeKit running in fast-catchup state](/src/assets/images/nodekit-state-running.png)

You will only be able to generate participation keys after your node is in a `RUNNING` state

### Generate Participation Keys

Press the `G` key to start generating participation keys.

NodeKit will ask the account address that will be participating in consensus. Enter your account address and press `ENTER`.

![NodeKit account address prompt](/src/assets/images/nodekit-partkey-gen-1.png)

### Select Participation Key Duration

NodeKit will ask the number of days that the participation keys will be valid for:

![NodeKit key information display](/src/assets/images/nodekit-partkey-gen-2.png)

You can press the `S` key to cycle through duration modes in days / months / rounds.

The longer your duration, the longer the participation key generation step will take to complete.

We recommend a value between 30 and 90 days.

### Key Generation

After you have selected your key duration, nodekit will instruct your node to generate participation keys.

The time required for this step will depend on your participation key duration. As an indicative wait time, a 30-day participation key should take between 4-6 minutes to generate.

<details>
<summary>Troubleshooting: Failed to get participation keys</summary>

Occasionally, Nodekit may fall out of sync with the Algorand node while waiting for the participation keys to be generated. In this case this error message will be shown:

`failed to get participation keys`

You can:

- wait for the participation keys to appear in the Accounts list
- try to generate a participation key again - If the key generation process is still running on the node, you will see a `Participation key generation already in progress` error

</details>

![NodeKit key generation progress](/src/assets/images/nodekit-partkey-gen-3.png)

When your participation keys are ready, nodekit will display the key information as shown below.

![NodeKit key generation complete](/src/assets/images/nodekit-partkey-gen-4.png)

You are now one step away from participating in Algorand consensus! The next step is to [register your keys online](#registering-your-keys-online).

## Registering Your Keys Online

After generating a participation key, you can press `R` to start registering it on the Algorand network.

You can also start this flow by pressing `R` on the [key information screen](#navigating-accounts-and-keys) shown below.

![NodeKit key information display](/src/assets/images/nodekit-partkey-gen-4.png)

After you press `R`, you will see a link that you can follow to sign your key registration transaction:

![NodeKit key registration link screen](/src/assets/images/nodekit-keyreg-online.png)

On most terminals, you can hold down `CTRL` or `CMD` and click the link, which will open it in your default browser. If this does not work, copy the link and paste it into your browser.

You will be taken to the Lora Transaction Wizard, where you should see the key information pre-filled:

![Lora Transaction Wizard interface](/src/assets/images/nodekit-lora-keyreg.png)

Next you need to:

1. Select `Connect Wallet` on the top right and connect your wallet.

2. Click the `Send` button on the bottom right. Your wallet should prompt you to sign the key registration transaction

3. Sign the transaction

The transaction will be submitted to the network. If it is accepted, you will see a visual confirmation in Lora similar to the one displayed below:

![Lora transaction success confirmation](/src/assets/images/nodekit-lora-txn-ok.png)

NodeKit will detect the key registration and take you back to the Key information view:

![NodeKit key registration success screen](/src/assets/images/nodekit-keyreg-success.png)

You can press `ESC` twice to get back to the home screen.

To confirm that your account is online, review the `STATUS` of your account. Accounts with an `ONLINE` status are participating in consensus.

That's it! If your account balance is over 30,000 ALGO, it will accumulate rewards for each block it proposes on the Algorand network.

:::note
The `Protocol Voting` label in the top right panel refers to the **consensus protocol upgrade process**, not your account participation.

## Navigating Accounts and Keys

If it is not running already, start nodekit with this command:

```bash showLineNumbers=false
./nodekit
```

### Navigating Accounts

If you have participation keys for more than one account on your node, you can navigate between accounts using the up and down arrow keys.

Press `ENTER` to view the keys list of the highlighted account.

Press `ESC` in the keys view to return to the accounts list.

![Demo of navigating between accounts](/src/assets/images/nodekit-navigate-accounts.gif)

### Navigating Keys

If you have more than one set of participating keys for your account, you can highlight them using the up and down arrow keys.

Press `ENTER` to view the key information.

From this screen, you can press `ESC` to return back to they keys list, `D` to delete a participation key, or `R` to register your key online or offline.
