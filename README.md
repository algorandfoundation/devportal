### ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/images` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

You can use the alias `@images` to simplify the image paths, e.g., `@images/smart-contract-workflow.png`

SVG icons must go into `src/icons` to be used with the `astro-icon` component. The built-in Starlight icon component does not support custom local icons. You can also specify the ID of any icon in the Iconify collection. [See usage guide here](https://github.com/natemoo-re/astro-icon?tab=readme-ov-file#iconify-icons).

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

### ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                    | Action                                           |
